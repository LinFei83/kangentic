/**
 * The complete set of assets a release must carry, for one version.
 *
 * The release gate (scripts/verify-release-assets.js) reads this file directly.
 * The launcher does NOT: packages/launcher/bin/kangentic.js is deliberately
 * zero-dependency and hardcodes its own copies of these filenames. So the two are
 * cross-CHECKED, not shared, and changing a name here does not update the
 * launcher. tests/unit/release-asset-manifest.test.ts is what pins them together,
 * along with electron-builder.yml's artifactName templates.
 *
 * It is a plain explicit list rather than something derived from
 * electron-builder.yml at runtime: the gate runs at the moment of publishing,
 * where a YAML-parsing bug would be expensive and hard to diagnose. Drift is
 * caught in CI instead.
 *
 * The three channel files are what electron-updater actually fetches, so a
 * release missing one of them is broken for that platform even though every
 * platform build succeeded. That is exactly how v0.35.0 shipped Windows-only.

/**
 * The macOS arch built today. Intel macs and linux arm64 have no artifacts.
 *
 * Adding a second macOS arch is NOT a matter of reassigning this constant: that
 * would rename the existing four mac entries and silently drop arm64 coverage.
 * Duplicate the four mac lines below for the new arch instead, and bump the asset
 * count the test and the docs hardcode (tests/unit/release-asset-manifest.test.ts,
 * docs/deployment.md, .claude/skills/release/SKILL.md). Those three say 11 BUILD
 * assets, and the docs also say a finished release carries 12: release.yml's
 * demo-posters job attaches the docs poster set after publishing, deliberately
 * outside this list, since this manifest is verified before that job runs.
