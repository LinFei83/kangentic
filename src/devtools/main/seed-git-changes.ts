/**
 * Dev-only: seed a realistic git changeset into ephemeral preview repos so the
 * Changes tab has something to review while iterating on it. The preview board
 * starts clean, so this is the fast path to "give me a diff to look at" without
 * hand-editing files in a clone.
 *
 * The changeset is shaped to exercise EVERY scope, status, diff-viewer, AND
 * commit-history-browser feature in one click:
 *   - a chain of commits ahead of base -> the 'Full branch vs base' scope, the
 *                                        ahead/behind badge, the last-commit line,
 *                                        AND a rich commit-history browser: many
 *                                        rows to scroll (COMMIT_CHAIN.length,
 *                                        comfortably over 10), varied synthetic
 *                                        authors and backdated timestamps (so the
 *                                        graph's relative-time column and each
 *                                        commit's ref badges look real rather
 *                                        than "all just now"), and distinct
 *                                        per-commit diffs to click through
 *   - history-shared.ts               -> committed across FOUR of those commits
 *                                        by four different synthetic authors, so
 *                                        the per-file "View history" popover has
 *                                        more than one row, and the blame gutter
 *                                        shows more than one hash/author (every
 *                                        other fixture file is touched by exactly
 *                                        one commit, so blame on it alone would
 *                                        never exercise multi-author rendering)
 *   - staged changes (index vs HEAD) -> the 'Staged' scope: Modified / Added /
 *                                        Deleted / Renamed
 *   - working changes (vs index)     -> the 'Working changes' scope, deliberately
 *                                        rich so it exercises the diff viewer:
 *       big.ts        a long file with two far-apart hunks -> collapse-unchanged,
 *                     next/prev-change navigation, per-file scroll memory
 *       inline.ts     an intra-line edit -> word-level diff
 *       whitespace.ts an indentation/trailing-space-only edit -> ignore-whitespace
 *       gone.ts       a deletion (D)
 *       newfile.ts    an untracked file (U)
 *       logo.png      a binary file -> binary detection ("cannot display diff")
 *       notes.md      a rich markdown edit (M) -> the markdown preview toggle
 *       changelog.markdown  a .markdown edit (M) -> the .markdown extension map,
 *                     and a second markdown file so the preview toggle's per-file
 *                     reset can be exercised by switching between the two
 *       removed.md    a deleted markdown file (D) -> preview falls back to the
 *                     old content instead of rendering blank
 *
 * The commit-history chain never touches big.ts / inline.ts / whitespace.ts /
 * notes.md / changelog.markdown after their single initial commit (each stays
 * exactly the content the working-tree mutation below expects to diff against)
 * - only staged-mod.ts and history-shared.ts get extra chain-only revisions, so
 * none of the precision-tuned diff-viewer fixtures above are disturbed.
 *
 * Seeds MULTIPLE repos in one click (every active task worktree the renderer
 * passes, plus the project), all sharing one `seed-N` directory so a single
 * click lands the same fixture wherever you look.
 *
 * SAFETY: silently skips any target not under the preview-projects root, so it
 * can never dirty the real source worktree (the repo `/preview` runs from) or a
 * user's real repo. The preview clones it does touch are throwaway and removed
 * on close.
 *
 * Build-excluded from production: imported only behind `__KANGENTIC_DEV__`
 * guards, so esbuild dead-code elimination drops it from prod bundles. See
 * `.claude/rules/dev-tooling-build-exclusion.md`.
