const FIXTURE_RELEASE_NOTES = `## What's New

- **Release notes modal** - see what changed before you restart to update.
- **Faster board load** - the initial swimlane render is now [twice as fast](https://github.com/Kangentic/kangentic).

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a crash when opening an empty board.
- \`Escape\` now closes the release-notes modal like every other dialog.
