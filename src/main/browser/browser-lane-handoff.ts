/**
 * Keep an agent's browser alive when the user closes the task's window.
 *
 * The product rule this implements: a browser an agent is using belongs to the
 * AGENT, not to a piece of UI. The user must be free to close the task detail,
 * move around the board, and switch projects without disconnecting an agent
 * that is midway through verifying something.
 *
 * The mechanism it works around: an Electron `<webview>` guest dies the instant
 * its DOM node unmounts. The renderer now avoids unmounting a live agent's pane
 * wherever it can (see `.claude/rules/retained-pane-never-remounts.md`): the
 * window is retained across a project switch, PARKED when the user closes it,
 * and the pane is HELD when the user hides it with the Browser pill. What is
 * left for this file is the pane that genuinely unmounts - a renderer reload,
 * the pane detaching into a pop-out, a window dropped by displacement to
 * another host, the task leaving the board. Reproduced live before parking
 * existed, and the registry names it:
 *
 *   [browser-pane] unregister ... reason=guest-destroyed
 *
 * From there the agent was stuck: every drive returned `no-pane-open`, whose
 * hint says to call `open_pane`, which refused because the project was no longer
 * the open one.
 *
 * ## What happens instead
 *
 * When a user-visible pane unmounts while its task still has a live agent session,
 * main opens an offscreen LANE at the same URL and registers it under a NEW
 * `lane_` handle for the same task. This is the task's SAME one surface in its
 * offscreen form, not a second one. An agent that omits `sessionId` resolves to
 * it through the ordinary caller-task rule, which ranks a lane right behind the
 * visible pane. An agent holding the old `pane_` handle is told the truth
 * instead of being retargeted: that handle now returns `surface-gone`, naming
 * the lane and saying that per-tab state did not carry over (the lane is a
 * fresh document in the same cookie jar).
 *
 * The user's close is still honoured: the window really closes and its renderer
 * surface really goes away. What survives is a headless browser the agent owns.
 * A pane the AGENT put away with `close_pane` is never handed off: the registry
 * flags that unregister as deliberate, and resurrecting the page in a lane the
 * agent just asked to close would be the same class of surprise this file
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Reclaim
 *
 * When the user reopens that task's Browser pane, the offscreen surface is
 * destroyed. Two surfaces for one task would otherwise make every implicit call
 * ambiguous (`multiple-panes`), and the visible pane is the better answer
 * whenever it exists - the user can see it, and every supervision guard (the
 * veil, the ring, the label, the pointer block) lives on it.
 *
 * Every lane is reclaimed that way, with no exception, because a task has
 * exactly one surface. There used to be one: a lane the agent asked for with
 * `isolated: true` was its own working surface and was never touched here. That
 * argument came out with the parameter - see `browser-lane-manager.ts`.
