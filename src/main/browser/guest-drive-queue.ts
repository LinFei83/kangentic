/**
 * Serializes CDP drives against ONE guest.
 *
 * Nothing used to. `withGuest` gated policy, resolved the pane, attached CDP and
 * ran, with no mutex and no per-guest queue, so concurrent callers interleaved
 * against a single guest. Multi-command sequences are the visible damage:
 * `typeText` awaits three dispatches PER CHARACTER, `clickAtCenterOfSelector` is
 * mouseMoved -> mousePressed -> mouseReleased awaited separately, and
 * `dragFromTo` is a press, N moves, and a release. Two callers overlapping any
 * of those produce interleaved input against one page, and neither of them can
 * tell.
 *
 * The refcount in `agent-input-signal.ts` is NOT this. It dedupes the renderer
 * ANNOUNCEMENT so an overlapping burst emits two pushes rather than two per
 * call; its own comment ("two tool calls can overlap on one pane") is direct
 * evidence that overlap was expected and unguarded.
 *
 * ## What this does not fix, stated plainly
 *
 * A mutex serializes COMMANDS, not INTENT. It cannot stop caller A navigating
 * away from the page caller B is midway through verifying - only separate
 * guests do that. And it cannot unwedge the transport: `captureScreenshot`
 * races its command against a timeout and ABANDONS rather than cancels it, so a
 * capture against a non-composited guest still head-of-line-blocks Electron's
 * own per-guest CDP queue no matter what this lock does.
 *
 * ## Why acquisition is bounded
 *
 * An unbounded FIFO turns one stuck holder into every later caller's problem,
 * which is strictly worse than the interleaving it replaces. So a drive that
 * cannot acquire within the bound refuses with an actionable error instead of
 * hanging. The bodies themselves are bounded separately (screenshot has its own
 * timeout, navigate is raced, and `wait` acquires per poll rather than holding
 * across its whole timeout).
 */

/**
 * How long a drive waits for the guest before refusing.
 *
 * Comfortably above the slowest bounded body (a navigation, at
 * NAVIGATE_TIMEOUT_MS) so a normal queued call always waits rather than
 * refusing, while a genuinely stuck guest still surfaces within one agent turn
 * instead of hanging forever.
