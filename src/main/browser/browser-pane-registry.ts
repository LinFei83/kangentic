/**
 * Registry mapping an open embedded Browser pane to its guest `<webview>`
 * webContents, so the `kangentic_browser_*` MCP tools can target the right
 * pane. The renderer is the only place that knows all three of taskId, the
 * agent session, and the guest's `getWebContentsId()`, so it registers each
 * pane via IPC on `dom-ready` and unregisters on unmount. The main process also
 * keeps the registry honest from the guest's own lifecycle events
 * (`did-navigate` -> updateUrl, `destroyed` -> unregister), which fire even
 * when a renderer cleanup is skipped (e.g. a hard reload). The tracked URL is
 * a fallback rather than the source of truth: `list()` reads it from the live
 * guest, since `did-navigate` misses same-document navigation entirely.
 *
 * ## Keyed by a SURFACE HANDLE bound to the guest, not by the agent session
 *
 * It used to be keyed by the task's agent session id, and `register()`
 * overwrote unconditionally. Every remount of the visible pane (task window
 * closed and reopened, pop-out and back, a hard reload) therefore re-bound the
 * SAME key to a brand-new guest: one session id was observed bound to nine
 * different webContents in a single agent session, and an agent holding it
 * silently addressed a different tab (fresh `sessionStorage`) on consecutive
 * calls, which presented as "the app keeps logging me out".
 *
 * A handle (`pane_<8hex>` minted here, `lane_<8hex>` minted by the lane
 * manager) now names exactly one guest webContents for its whole life.
 * Registering the same guest again (a `/clear` rotates the owning session)
 * updates the entry in place and keeps the handle; a different guest always
 * gets a new one. A handle whose guest is gone stays remembered for a while so
 * the caller is told what happened and what replaced it, rather than being
 * silently retargeted.
 *
 * Main-process state, so no HMR concerns (esbuild does not Fast-Refresh main).

/**
 * What kind of surface an entry points at.
 *
 * `pane` is the user-visible `<webview>` inside a task-detail window, owned by
 * the renderer. `lane` is a main-process offscreen `BrowserWindow` opened for
 * one caller so concurrent workers stop sharing a viewport.
 *
 * A lane deliberately lives in THIS registry rather than a parallel one: it
 * keeps a single resolver, a single liveness self-heal, and a single shutdown
 * path, so `withGuest` needed no change at all to drive one. The resolver DOES
 * rank by kind (a visible pane wins over a lane), because the ranking is what
 * keeps an implicit call deterministic in the one window where a task holds
 * both: the returning pane registers before the reclaim destroys the offscreen
 * surface it replaces. `close_pane` destroys lanes in main instead of pushing a close to
 * the renderer: a lane has no task-detail window and no `browserOpenTasks`

   * A caller bound to a task never falls through to another task's pane. That
   * fall-through was observed live: an agent whose own pane had died navigated
   * a sibling task's logged-in app to an identity-provider URL, because "the
   * single pane in the project" happened to be the sibling's. A preference that
   * matches nothing now refuses with `no-pane-open` and says so; only a caller
   * with no identity (a human-driven client, the two-segment
   * `.kangentic/mcp-config.json` URL, a Command Terminal session) still lands
   * on the project-wide rule.
