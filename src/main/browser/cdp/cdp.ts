 * with text inserts by itself. Measured on Electron 41 against a live guest

 *    field that filters keys received them anyway;
 *  - a page that handles printable keys on keydown got every character TWICE.
 *    xterm.js does, which covers Kangentic's own terminal;
 *  - a newline lost its Enter: `"query\n"` submitted no form, and `"a\nb"`
 *    reached a textarea as `ab`.
 * Plain inputs, `input` events, contenteditable and non-ASCII text behaved the
 * same under both encodings.
 *
 * A newline is Enter carrying `\r`, the text a real Enter produces. A `\r\n`
