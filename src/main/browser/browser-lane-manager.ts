/**
 * Browser LANES: the OFFSCREEN form of a task's one browser surface.
 *
 * A task has exactly one browser surface. It is normally the visible `<webview>`
 * pane; a lane is what that surface falls back to when no pane can be mounted -
 * the user closed the task window, or the project is backgrounded and the board
 * layer renders only the open project's tasks. The agent never chooses a lane
 * and cannot ask for one.
 *
 * ## Why an agent cannot ask for one
 *
 * It could until 2026-09-21, through `kangentic_browser_open_pane { isolated:
 * true }`, and the argument for that was concurrency: several agents under one
 * task resolving to the same pane and interleaving navigations. It was removed
 * because the concurrency was never real and the cost was. Parallel callers
 * already contend for a single guest and are serialized by `guest-drive-queue`,
 * so four lanes bought a queue with four heads rather than four workers. Against
 * that: a lane sets no `browserGuestTasks` entry (only `BrowserPane.tsx` does,
 * on the guest's `dom-ready`), so nothing in the UI said one existed, the user
 * could not close it, and every supervision guard built for the pane - the veil,
 * the ring, the label, the pointer block - lives on the pane and reached none of
 * it. An agent completed a whole verification run in a lane with no browser
 * anywhere on screen. See `docs/embedded-browser.md`.
 *
 * What replaces it: the offscreen surface is now pushed to the renderer, so the
 * card globe and the header pill light up for it exactly as they do for a pane,
 * and opening the Browser pill converts it back into a visible pane.
 *
 * ## Why offscreen, and why that is safe here
 *
 * Chromium stops compositing a window that is minimized or fully occluded, and
 * `Page.captureScreenshot` then never resolves - which is why a hidden
 * `<webview>` is NOT a viable lane, and why `.claude/rules/retained-pane-never-
 * remounts.md` insists a background pane hide with `opacity: 0` only.
 *
 * Offscreen rendering is exempt by construction rather than by luck:
 * `initially_hidden` is set only in the NON-offscreen branch of Electron's
 * `electron_api_web_contents.cc`, and `OffScreenWebContentsView` declares no
 * visibility methods at all, so `show: false` never marks the WebContents
 * hidden and it keeps its own `ui::Compositor`.
 *
 * Measured on this build (Electron 41.1.1 / Chromium 146.0.7680.166) before
 * committing to it, because every one of these silently kills the design:
 *   - `isMinimized()` on a never-shown offscreen window is FALSE, so
 *     `withGuest`'s compositing precondition does not refuse every lane drive.
 *     (It resolves the lane window itself, since a lane guest has no
 *     `hostWebContents` - that was the specific risk.)
 *   - CDP `Page.captureScreenshot` RESOLVES against an offscreen target.
 *   - `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` and `mouseWheel` both work, and the page
 *     genuinely receives them (a click listener fired; the page scrolled).
 *     These are asymmetric with key events, so keys passing proves nothing.
 *   - Destroying one offscreen window leaves its siblings alive and driveable.
 *
 * ## Cost, and why it stays bounded
 *
 * Each lane is a renderer process, which is inherent to any isolation
 * substrate. The cost that actually bites is CPU: offscreen rendering copies a
 * FULL frame bitmap on every paint, so an animating page in a lane nobody is
 * watching would burn CPU at the default 60fps. Lanes therefore run at
 * `LANE_FRAME_RATE` and are created on demand and destroyed eagerly.
 *
 * Sandboxing was verified not to interfere: with `sandbox: true` a lane loads,
 * captures, and receives wheel input identically to an unsandboxed one, so the
 * hardened `webPreferences` below cost nothing.
 */

/**
 * Frames per second for a lane.
 *
 * Throttled because offscreen rendering copies a FULL frame bitmap on every
 * paint, so an animating page in a lane nobody is watching would otherwise burn
 * CPU at 60fps for no one.
 *
 * 10 rather than a lower floor, and the difference is measured, not guessed.
 * Wheel-driven scroll takes this long to land on Electron 41.1.1:
 *
 *   unthrottled  100ms
 *   10fps        100ms   <- no penalty at all
 *   2fps         300ms   <- 3x slower
 *
 * At 2fps a lane's input settles noticeably late, and an agent that scrolls and
 * then immediately screenshots captures the PRE-scroll frame - a silently wrong
 * answer, which is worse than a slow one. 10fps costs nothing on that axis and
 * is still a 6x saving over the default. Do not lower it without re-measuring
 * that table.
 *
 * Capture itself is unaffected: `Page.captureScreenshot` forces its own frame,
 * and an explicit `invalidate()` before capturing changed nothing (identical
 * byte counts at every frame rate tested).
