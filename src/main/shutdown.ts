 * the quit proceed, Electron's normal shutdown tears down all child processes.
 *
 * The one sanctioned exception lives OUTSIDE this function: after it returns,
 * the before-quit handler (pty/shutdown/before-quit-handler.ts) holds the
 * quit for the timer-bounded PTY exit-callback drain and then re-issues
 * app.quit(). That is why this returns the kill report the drain waits on.
 *
 * Every cleanup step before the PTY kill runs through runCleanupStep, so one
 * failing handle-closer cannot leave every PTY alive and hang teardown until
 * the hard failsafe. The lone bare call in that region is the getSessionManager()
 * read, which is not a cleanup step: wrapping it would buy nothing, because a
