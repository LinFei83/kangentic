/**
 * Builds the `setWindowOpenHandler` callback for non-webview WebContents (the
 * main window, and any pop-out window - both fire `web-contents-created`).
 * Those contents get no window-open policy by default, so a renderer
 * `window.open()` falls through to Electron's default: spawning a bare,
 * chrome-less BrowserWindow. This handler denies that always, routing an
 * allowed URL out to the OS default browser instead.
 *
 * This is defense in depth, not the primary path for any one feature. xterm
 * OSC 8 links are claimed by `createTerminalLinkHandler` before they can reach
 * here (and gated more tightly, on TERMINAL_LINK_SCHEMES, since terminal bytes
 * are agent-controlled). What DOES still land here is any other
 * renderer-originated window.open - the realistic one being a middle-click or
 * Ctrl+click on an agent-authored markdown link, which Chromium turns into a
 * new-window request rather than the `onClick` that MarkdownRenderer
 * intercepts. That is why the allowlist here matches the shell:openExternal
 * IPC channel's (EXTERNAL_OPEN_SCHEMES, mailto: included): it is the same link,
 * and a middle-click should not resolve differently from a left-click.
 *
 * `openExternal` is injected so this stays unit-testable without importing
 * Electron's `shell` module.

 * handler below allows http(s) popups instead, on terms that keep the surface
 * the old deny handler was protecting closed:
 *
 *  - The popup is CHROMED and its title is OURS, forced to the live origin. An
 *    OS title bar is the only origin indicator the window has, and a page free
 *    to name itself is exactly the phishing affordance to avoid.
 *  - Its `webPreferences` restate the guest's hardening in full. A child window
 *    inherits NONE of its opener's preferences on Electron 30 and later, so
 *    anything omitted here silently reverts to the framework default.
 *  - It shares the guest's `Session` OBJECT, not a partition string. That keeps
 *    the OAuth cookie in the same per-worktree jar, and - less obviously - keeps
 *    the popup in the opener's browsing context group, without which
 *    `window.opener`, `postMessage`, and the `popup.closed` poll that nearly
 *    every OAuth flow relies on are all severed.
 *
 * See `docs/embedded-browser.md` decisions 10 to 12.
