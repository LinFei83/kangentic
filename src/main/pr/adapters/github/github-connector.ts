 * the button works, so calling it `blocked` would break the promise.
 * `mergeable` is the fallback when `mergeStateStatus` is absent or a value this
 * code does not know. `reviewDecision` is compared against the one named value:

 *
 * BLOCKED is the one state the triple cannot tell apart: a required check

 * report it. The check rollup splits them (see `classifyRollup`), and a check

 * of BLOCKED once the base moves, so reading the rollup for one and not the
 * other would make the chip flip on a merge somebody else did.
 *

 * column merges a green PR past its missing review with `gh pr merge --admin`,

 * - **MERGED.** A merged PR's own commits ARE in its base afterwards, so
 *   containment cannot tell "this task's work, now merged" from "inherited base
 *   history", and rejecting would clear a correct link (a task on a non-default
 *   base whose own PR landed via a real merge commit). The merged shape is
 *   already covered by the `mergeCommitOid` filter. Every other state has at
 *   least one commit between base and head, so containment there proves the
 *   commit is not that PR's work.
 * - **Undetermined** (`null`: the base ref was never fetched locally). Fall back
 *   to the `branchHint` rule in `disambiguate`, so an unfetched ref costs a
 *   mislink guard rather than an existing badge.
 *
 *   KNOWN GAP, not a settled trade-off: because this filter runs before
 *   `disambiguate`, dropping a proven-contained sibling can leave a
 *   kept-undetermined candidate as the LONE survivor, which then slips past the
 *   hint rule's ambiguity guard (it only returns null when MORE than one
 *   non-matching candidate remains). A candidate never verified as its own work
 *   can therefore win a comparison that previously returned null. Deciding
 *   whether an undetermined survivor should still count toward that threshold is
 *   open; see docs/pr-integration.md.
 *
 * The probes are memoized per base ref and awaited sequentially on purpose: this
 * runs inside a `ghQueue` slot, so the cost is throughput, not a deadlock. The
 * git read queue caps EXECUTION at 2 whatever we do here, so a `Promise.all`
 * could not defeat that cap; what it would do is submit every probe at once and
 * deepen that shared queue (up to `GH_CONCURRENCY` resolves can be in flight),
 * delaying the other USER-priority readers on it such as the Done-move confirm
 * probe. Awaiting sequentially holds this call to one slot at a time.
