 * anchor is written from a worktree read, and the shared checkout's HEAD is
 * not per task (three concurrent no-worktree tasks share it). The push command
 * belongs to exactly one session, so its destination belongs to exactly one
 * task. Tier 5 then resolves the PR from it with no git read at all.
 *
 * Recorded only; nothing resolves from here. The push precedes the PR, and a
 * non-force resolve now would stamp the 60s per-task throttle that the
 * `pr-candidate` resolve seconds later would then be coalesced by.
 *
 * Refused for three names. The task's own local branch is Tier 2's / Tier 4's
 * anchor already (and `pushed_branch` is documented as "when that differs").
 * The stored `pushed_branch` is a no-op. The task's effective base is the one
 * name that could link WRONGLY: a merge-back's `git push origin HEAD:develop`
 * would otherwise make Tier 5 answer with the base branch's own PR.
 *
 * The patch is only `{ id, pushed_branch }` against a row re-read under the
 * task lock, so it cannot clobber a concurrent PR-link write.
