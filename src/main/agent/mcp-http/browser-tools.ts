/**
 * The user-facing `kangentic_browser_*` MCP tool family. Drives the embedded
 * Browser pane (an Electron `<webview>` guest) via the in-process CDP driver -
 * no HTTP bridge, no lockfile. Unlike the dev-only `kangentic_devtools_*`
 * tools (which target the app's own window over HTTP), these ship in
 * production and target the dev server the USER has loaded in a task's pane.
 *
 * Every tool routes through `withGuest`, which gates the call against the
 * global automation policy, resolves the target pane, attaches CDP, and shapes
 * a `{ kind, detail }` error envelope. Capability tiers: observe (screenshot,
 * query, console, wait), interact (click/type/keypress/drag), navigate, eval.
 *
 * Every target is scoped to the connection's own project (the `<projectId>`
 * segment of the MCP URL). This family deliberately takes NO `project`
 * argument and is deliberately NOT handed the `RequestResolver`, so "there is
 * no path to another project's pane" is a type-level guarantee rather than a
 * convention. See `.claude/rules/browser-automation-driver.md`.

        "Set the viewport the task's Browser surface lays out against, so you can verify a responsive layout at a real desktop width instead of guessing from CSS. A docked pane is only as wide as the task window leaves it, which is usually below every desktop breakpoint. Pass width and height in CSS pixels; the response reports the viewport you actually GOT, measured from the page. `exact` tolerates 2px, so a requested 1080 reported as 1079 with `exact: true` is a correct result, not a clamp - the fit rounds to whole pixels. `exact: false` means a real shortfall, and `note` says what caused it. On an offscreen lane or a popped-out window this resizes the real surface, un-maximizing it first if it has to. On a docked pane it overrides the viewport in place, which is the option that KEEPS YOUR PAGE: no reload, sessionStorage and in-memory state survive, and your surface handle stays valid. The pane is zoomed out to fit, so the user sees the whole layout you asked for rather than a corner of it. Screenshots show that whole layout too, but a screenshot can hold no more pixels than the pane has, so a 1600-wide layout in a 740px pane comes back about 740 wide; `note` gives the exact size. For readable detail, kangentic_browser_screenshot_element captures a region at up to 1:1, and kangentic_browser_pop_out gives a real window whose viewport screenshots are 1:1. Pass `reset: true` to put both the viewport and the zoom back. An override survives navigation and lasts until you reset it, your session ends, or the user clears it from the pane.",
