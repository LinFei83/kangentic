/**
 * Builds the top-level MCP `instructions` string surfaced to agents at
 * initialize time (Claude Code renders it as `## kangentic` in its
 * system prompt).
 *
 * Two jobs: (1) tell the agent how to route task-creation and other
 * cross-project tool calls when the user's prompt names a project that
 * differs from the URL-path-bound "active" project (without this guidance
 * the agent silently defaults to the active project and misfiles tasks,
 * e.g. filing a Kangentic bug into OCC-RBDMS-OKIES because that's the
 * project the Claude Code session is bound to); and (2) tell the agent
 * when to reach for the kangentic_browser_* tools to verify the running
 * app, advertising any Browser panes currently open in the active project.
 *
 * The registered-project list is embedded live so the agent sees real
 * routing candidates without needing a separate kangentic_list_projects
 * round-trip first. We cap the list length to keep the string short;
 * when truncated we point to kangentic_list_projects for the full set.
