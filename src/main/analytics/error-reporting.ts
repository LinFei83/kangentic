 * Initialize Sentry error reporting. Must be called BEFORE app.whenReady(),

 * normalizePathsIntegration rewrites stack-frame paths and URLs relative to
 * the app root (so the user's home directory never reaches Sentry through an
 * app stack frame), sendDefaultPii stays false, and Sentry's server-side data
 * scrubbing is on by default. Any further scrubbing rule belongs in the Sentry
 * UI (Advanced Data Scrubbing), not in a custom beforeSend here.
 *
 * BREADCRUMBS are an exception to that stance, filtered on the machine by
 * `beforeBreadcrumb` (src/shared/sentry-breadcrumbs.ts). normalizePathsIntegration never touches
 * them, and no server-side rule can recognize a task title or a column prompt
 * inside a console line, so the policy runs before a crumb enters the ring.
 *
 * FILTERING is a separate concern and does live here, in `ignoreErrors`:
 * deciding that a whole class of event is un-actionable and should never become
 * an issue is a product judgement about our own code, not a data-privacy rule.
 * See the annotated entries below.
 *
 * NATIVE CRASH EVENTS are the one exception to the no-beforeSend stance above.
 * `ignoreErrors` is the `eventFiltersIntegration`, which matches only an event's
 * message and its exception type and value. A minidump event has none of those,
 * so the matcher sees an empty candidate list and the filter is a no-op on it.
 * The thing that says whether the crash was even ours lives in the attached
 * dump, not on the event, and Sentry derives the stack and the image list from
 * that dump only AFTER upload. So this one class is split in `beforeSend`
 * (filterNativeCrashEvent, reached through beforeSendEvent, above), which is the
 * only hook that can see the attachment. A foreign crash becomes one grouped
 * warning, and its dump is removed from the upload. That removal is an exception
 * to the scrubbing stance, the same kind as the stderr tail's home directory
 * becoming `~`: the dump is another program's memory, and no Sentry-side rule
 * can scrub a file it has already received.
 *
 * `beforeSend` does one other thing: beforeSendEvent also TAGS a frame-capped
 * stack (tagTruncatedStack, above). That is annotation on an event we keep.
 *
 * Errors only: release-health session tracking (the MainProcessSession
 * integration, on by default) is filtered out, and tracing/replay are never
 * enabled. Aptabase's app_error stays as the coarse error-rate pulse on the
 * product dashboard; Sentry is the diagnostic tool.
