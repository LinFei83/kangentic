/**
 * Per-session latch that fires exactly once when an agent first produces
 * "meaningful" PTY output. Used by SessionManager to lift the shimmer
 * overlay in the renderer.
 *
 * What counts as meaningful is adapter-specific. Claude matches the
 * cursor-hide escape (`\x1b[?25l` - see ClaudeAdapter.detectFirstOutput), as
 * do several other TUI adapters. The decision is delegated to the agent
 * adapter via the `detectFirstOutput` callback passed to `consume()`; when no
 * detector is given, any non-empty chunk qualifies.
 *
 * CAUTION: this latch is a shimmer-overlay heuristic, not proof the AGENT is
 * up. Shell preambles can carry the very escapes the detectors match (pwsh
 * 7.6 emits `\x1b[?25l` at startup - see buildSpawnClearPrelude in
 * src/shared/paths.ts), so on such shells the latch trips on SHELL bytes
 * tens of ms after spawn. Anything that needs "the agent is demonstrably
 * driving the terminal" must key on the stream's alt-screen entry instead
 * (PtyBufferManager's onAltScreenEnter) - misreading this latch as an
 * agent-liveness signal is how the task #573 spawn-race fix initially
 * missed its target.
 *
 * The tracker holds only a set of session IDs. Call `removeSession()`
 * when a session is fully cleaned up, or `clear()` during killAll().
