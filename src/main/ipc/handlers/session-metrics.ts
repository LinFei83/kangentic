/**
 * Capture session metrics (cost, tokens, model, duration, tool calls,
 * compactions) from the in-memory caches and persist them to the session
 * record in the DB.
 *
 * Synchronous on purpose: better-sqlite3 is sync, and this runs on the
 * synchronous shutdown path and inside `withTaskLock` regions, so it must not
 * await. The cumulative-token refinement that needs a file read is split out
 * into the fire-and-forget {@link refineTranscriptTokens}; call it right after
 * this on the run-ending paths (exit / suspend / move-to-Done).
 *
 * Must be called BEFORE the session is removed from the manager (caches are
 * cleared on remove).
 *
 * Tokens written here are the live status-line SNAPSHOT (current context window,
 * not cumulative on Claude Code 2.1.132+). `refineTranscriptTokens` overwrites
 * them with the transcript-derived cumulative when available.
 *
 * When `usageCache[sessionId]` is empty (session exited before status.json
 * appeared, queued session that never spawned, etc.) the cost/token/model
 * columns are written as NULL instead of zero. This matters because
 * `getSummaryForTask` filters `WHERE total_cost_usd IS NOT NULL` to pick the
 * latest meaningful record - a zero row would mask a prior real one. The
 * tool_call_count and compaction_count are always written because they are
 * derived from counters that are accurate independently of usage telemetry.
 *
 * The same record is also written to `usage_history` whenever metrics were
 * actually captured (i.e. `usage` is defined) so that lifetime period totals
 * survive task and session deletion. The gate is `if (usage)`, NOT `cost > 0`:
 * subscription users (Claude Plus/Max) report cost = 0 with real token counts.
 * `usage_history` intentionally keeps the per-capture SNAPSHOT tokens (period
 * stats SUM across rows; cumulative-per-lineage tokens would double-count across
 * a session's `--resume` rows). The transcript cumulative lives only in the
 * `sessions` table, where `getSummaryForTask` dedups it latest-per-session.
 *
 * Best-effort: swallows all errors so it never breaks the calling flow.

/**
 * Fire-and-forget backfill of a session record's tool-count columns from the
 * agent's transcript. Mirrors {@link refineTranscriptTokens} exactly (same
 * adapter-resolution, path-sourcing, and best-effort structure); call it right
 * after that function on the same run-ending paths.
 *
 * Backfills ONLY an empty live count (see
 * `SessionRepository.updateTranscriptToolCounts`'s guard) - it corrects
 * sessions whose ToolStart/ToolEnd hook events never reached the live
 * `UsageAccumulator` (a parked/suspended session reads 0 despite real cost and
 * tokens) without ever regressing a healthy live count.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE: a record whose `total_cost_usd` stayed NULL (a session that exited
 * before any status.json appeared) is excluded from the `getSummaryForTask` /
 * `listAllSummaries` lifetime aggregates by their `total_cost_usd IS NOT NULL`
 * filter, so a count backfilled onto such a cost-less record is written but not
 * surfaced there. The intended target - a parked/suspended session with real
 * cost - has non-null cost and does surface, so this is a boundary of the
 * aggregates, not a regression.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION: on a same-action move of a still-running session straight
 * to Done, `task_complete` reads `getSummaryForTask` synchronously before this
 * async backfill lands, so that one event leg may under-report. The dominant
 * path (suspend earlier, move to Done later) has the backfill long landed by
 * the time `task_complete` fires, and every later DB read is accurate. This is
 * NOT awaited deliberately: awaiting it here would put file I/O back inside
 * the `withTaskLock` region the split-out design (see the JSDoc above) exists
 * to avoid, for a marginal gain on one analytics event leg.
 *
 * The adapter is resolved generically from the session's recorded agent name -
 * no agent-name branching (agent-adapters-boundary rule); adapters without a
 * `transcriptToolCounts` capability are a no-op.
