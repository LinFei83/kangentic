 * On macOS, apps launched from Finder/Spotlight/Dock inherit a minimal

 * user's shell PATH from ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile. The same problem
 * exists on Linux for apps launched from GNOME/KDE desktop launchers.
 *
 * This helper spawns the user's login shell, reads its PATH, and merges
 * any new segments into process.env.PATH so downstream consumers
 * (agent detection via `which()`, git, child_process.spawn) can find
 * user-installed binaries like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Aider, etc.
 *
 * Implementation detail: we run `/usr/bin/env` inside the shell and
 * parse its output rather than echoing $PATH directly. Reasons:
 *   1. Works across all POSIX shells AND fish (fish treats $PATH as an
 *      array, so `echo $PATH` produces space-separated not colon-sep).
 *      `/usr/bin/env` always prints colon-separated PATH regardless.
 *   2. Isolates us from user-defined echo/printf aliases.
 *   3. Is the same pattern used by shell-env / fix-path (Sindre
 *      Sorhus's canonical packages that ship in VSCode, GitHub
 *      Desktop, Slack, Discord, and most major Electron apps).
 *
 * The fix is scoped to PATH only - we do not import arbitrary
 * environment variables from the user's shell. Any failure (timeout,
 * shell rc error, parse error) is logged and ignored; the app
 * continues with whatever PATH it had, relying on fallback paths
 * wired into each AgentDetector.
 *
 * Set KANGENTIC_SHELL_ENV=off to skip this step entirely (escape
 * hatch for users whose rc files hang or error).
