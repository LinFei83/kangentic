/**
 * Run a user-provided init script (the `git.initScript` "Post-Worktree
 * Script") in a freshly created worktree.
 *
 * Cross-platform shell handling: the script is passed as a single command
 * STRING with `shell: true` and NO args array (spawnWithAbort omits the args
 * array when `args` is undefined). Node then runs it through the platform's
 * shell (`process.env.ComSpec` / cmd.exe on Windows, `/bin/sh` on POSIX), so
 * the user's script is parsed by the native shell on every OS without us
 * hardcoding a shell path or path separator. Omitting an args array avoids the
 * Node DEP0190 deprecation that fires when an args array is combined with
 * `shell: true` (the same reasoning documented in agent/shared/exec-version.ts).
 * On macOS spawnWithAbort spells the same `/bin/sh -c` out and runs it through
 * node-pty's spawn-helper, so nothing the script starts inherits Crashpad's
 * exception port (see pty/spawn/shell-launch.ts).
 *
 * The shared spawnWithAbort lifecycle handles the wall-clock timeout, external
 * cancellation (a superseding move or app shutdown), drained stdio, and
 * single-settle. The signal-kill message does not assert a timeout cause, since
 * an external or OS signal is not necessarily a timeout.
 *
 * Rejects on non-zero exit, kill-by-signal, or timeout/abort so the caller can
 * treat a failed init script as fatal.
