/**
 * In-memory scroll-position memory for the Changes view diff editor.
 *
 * The Monaco DiffEditor stays mounted across file switches, so scroll position
 * would otherwise bleed between files. This module remembers each file's scroll
 * position (keyed by a task-scoped scroll key plus the file path) so revisiting
 * a file restores where the user left off. The first time a file is opened the
 * map has no entry, and the caller falls back to revealing the first change.
 *
 * The map is module-scope and preserved across HMR (Pattern A in
 * `.claude/rules/hmr-patterns.md`), mirroring `savedScrollPositions` in
 * `src/renderer/hooks/useTerminal.ts`. It is intentionally NOT persisted to the
 * database: a fresh app start falls back to the first-change reveal.

/**
 * Clamp a saved scrollTop to what the editor's CURRENT layout can actually
 * scroll to.
 *
 * A diff editor's modified-side scroll height is not a property of the file: it
 * includes the alignment view zones that pad the modified side against the
 * original's inserted/deleted lines. Those zones only exist once the diff has
 * been computed, so between a model swap and the diff result the same file is
 * measurably shorter than it will be. Handing Monaco an offset past the end
 * leaves the scroll state disagreeing with the view model's line count.
 *
 * This clamp is hygiene on OUR call site, and that is all it is. It was added
 * for Sentry DESKTOP-8 ("Illegal value for lineNumber") without reproducing
 * that throw, and DESKTOP-19 is the same class recurring past it. Reading
 * DESKTOP-19's frames against monaco 0.56.0 shows why it cannot be the fix:
 * the offset that throws is set on the ORIGINAL editor by Monaco's own
 * scroll-mirroring autorun (diffEditorViewZones.js's "update scroll original"),
 * computed from the modified side rather than passed through here, and the
 * out-of-range read happens on the original's viewport. Nothing this function
 * returns can reach it. Keep the clamp, but do not treat it as coverage for
 * that crash class.
 *
 * Restoring past the end saturates at the bottom. A non-finite input (a
 * disposed or never-laid-out editor reporting NaN) degrades to the top.
