/**
 * Puts the user's keyboard focus back when an agent-driven CDP input dispatch
 * pulls it into a Browser pane's `<webview>` guest.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM. `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` lands a real synthesized mousedown in
 * the guest. Blink answers by focusing the guest frame, and the browser process
 * propagates that up until the embedder's `<webview>` element is
 * `document.activeElement` - so the terminal the user was mid-sentence in is
 * blurred and the rest of the keystrokes go into the page.
 *
 * TRIGGERED BY THE SIGNAL, NOT BY A FOCUS EVENT. Main pushes an explicit "an
 * agent is driving guest N" interval (`browser:agentInput`), and that is what
 * arms and disarms this guard. The embedder does receive a trusted `focusout` on
 * the victim when the steal happens (measured), but it is deliberately NOT used
 * as a trigger - see the next paragraph, which is the whole reason this file is
 * shaped the way it is.
 *
 * THE RESTORE HAPPENS ONLY AFTER THE DRIVE ENDS, NEVER DURING IT. Measured on
 * Electron 41 against a live guest: taking focus back mid-drive silently BREAKS
 * the tool that is running. `kangentic_browser_type` is a click followed by
 * `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` key events, and once focus is pulled out of the guest
 * the guest's own focused element loses it too, so every character lands nowhere.
 * The measurement was unambiguous - the same type call produced an empty input
 * after a restore and the full text without one. So an "early fire" on `focusout`
 * would trade a focus bug for a silent input-dropping bug in the same feature.
 *
 * The user's focus is therefore held for the length of ONE tool call, which is
 * tens of milliseconds for the tools that dispatch input at all. The long-running
 * observe tools (`wait`) never steal focus in the first place, because they
 * dispatch no input.
 *
 * Two reasons the signal is also better than any DOM heuristic:
 *
 *  1. Clicking into a guest routes input to the guest widget and produces NO
 *     mousedown on the host document, so "was there a trusted user gesture on the
 *     pane" cannot distinguish an agent click from a real one.
 *  2. Main is the only caller of `Input.*`, so it knows the exact interval.
 *
 * Nothing runs, and no listener is installed, while no agent is driving.
 *
 * See `.claude/rules/agent-driven-focus.md`.
