/**
 * Renderer side of the host memory pressure push (Sentry DESKTOP-16). Main
 * owns the sampling and the edge-triggered decision (see
 * `src/main/diagnostics/host-memory.ts`); this store only turns an arrived
 * event into a persistent toast, and dismisses that toast when main reports
 * recovery. There is no `load*`/`sync*` here (the truth is a push, not
 * something to re-fetch on HMR), so unlike the IPC-backed stores this needs
 * no `vite:afterUpdate` registration - same shape as `updater-store.ts`'s
 * `receiveUpdate`.
 *
 * Pattern A DOES apply, for the same reason `toast-store.ts` applies it to
 * its own `toasts` array: this file is not a Fast Refresh boundary, so an
 * edit here re-runs `create()` and resets the store. `toast-store.ts`
 * deliberately preserves visible toasts across that cycle, so a `duration: 0`
 * pressure toast survives the reload while an unprotected `pressureToastId`
 * would come back null - leaving a persistent toast on screen with no id left
 * to dismiss it. That is the exact bug the recovery push exists to close, so
 * the id and the event that produced it are preserved as a pair.
 *
 * Not Pattern-E instance-pinned (unlike `updater-store.ts`): nothing
 * subscribes to this store reactively. Every read is a one-shot `getState()`
 * from an IPC handler, so there is no stale-subscriber hazard.
