## Commands

- `npm start` - Start in development mode (Vite HMR + esbuild watch)
- `npm run build` - Production build to `.vite/build/`
- `npm test` - Run all Playwright E2E tests

- `npm run package` - Package for distribution (unpacked directory)
- `npm run make` - Build installer (NSIS on Windows, DMG on macOS, deb/rpm on Linux)
- `npm run build:demo` - Build the renderer for a plain browser into `dist/demo/` (the web demo
  the site and docs embed; see `demo/README.md`). `npm run test:demo` smoke-tests that build;
  `npm run demo:serve` serves it for a manual look (open `/demo/stage.html`); `npm run demo:measure`
  reports its weight and boot timings; `npm run demo:posters` shoots the docs poster set from it
  and zips it with a manifest (the `demo-posters-<version>.zip` release asset). This is the WEB
  build, not `/preview`, which launches the Electron desktop app and serves none of it.

**Worktrees need `npm install`:** Git worktrees do not share `node_modules/` with the main
repo. Always run `npm install` in a worktree before running any npm scripts (`npm run
typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npx playwright test`, etc.). Without it, binaries like `tsc`
won't be found.

## Architecture

### Data Flow
1. User drags a task between columns (swimlanes)
2. `TASK_MOVE` IPC handler fires in main process
3. Transition engine checks for actions attached to that lane transition
4. `spawn_agent` action builds a Claude CLI command and spawns a PTY session
5. Terminal output streams to renderer via IPC

### Key Patterns
- **IPC channels** defined in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts` - single source of truth. Wiring an
  endpoint through all 7 layers: see `.claude/rules/ipc-7-layer-parity.md`.
- **Stores** use Zustand with IPC bridge: renderer store calls `window.electronAPI.*`, main
  process handles via `ipcMain.handle`
- **PTY sessions** handle cross-platform shells (PowerShell needs `& ` prefix, WSL splits into
  exe + args, fish/nushell skip `--login`)
- **Claude CLI** is invoked with `cwd` set to the project directory (or worktree path) so that
  `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, and commands are loaded into context
- **HMR / dev-mode parity** - The team dogfoods Kangentic from `npm start` daily, so dev mode
  must be visually and behaviourally indistinguishable from a production boot. Patterns A
  through D and their enforcement: `.claude/rules/hmr-patterns.md`.
- **Command Terminal** - Ctrl+Shift+P opens an ephemeral "transient" session with no DB
  persistence, hosted in a SECOND window-manager layer (`components/command-bar/`) separate
  from the board task-detail layer. Windows are keyed by a durable SLOT, geometry is global
  but population is per-project (reconciled before the layer mounts), a reattach NEVER fetches
  or checks out, and the branch is a per-project fact re-derived by one layer bridge.
  Rules: `.claude/rules/command-terminal.md`. Design history: [docs/command-terminal.md](docs/command-terminal.md).
- **Activity marks** - The nine agent/terminal activity glyphs are owned upstream in
  `@kangentic/branding`, NOT hand-authored here, and render only through
  `components/ActivityMark.tsx`. Motion is always on a COMPOSITED property, marks are
  `currentColor` only (the call site supplies the tone), and an icon that changes ELEMENT TYPE
  between states must render through `components/IconSlot.tsx` or it swallows the click.
  Rules: `.claude/rules/activity-marks.md`. Design history: [docs/activity-marks.md](docs/activity-marks.md).
- **Settings tab separator** - Each tab in `SETTINGS_TABS` (`settings-tabs.ts`) declares a
  `category`. `'project'` tabs (General, Theme, Agent, Git, Browser, Shortcuts) are per-project
  settings, saved to `.kangentic/config.json`, and hidden when no project is selected.
  `'system'` tabs (Board, Task, Changes, Terminal, Behavior, Performance, Hotkeys, Notifications,
  Dictation, Memory, MCP Server, Agent Browser, Mobile Devices, Privacy, Developer) are shared
  settings that apply across all projects, saved to global config, and remain fully functional with
  no project open. The Task tab holds task-presentation settings split out of Board (Card Density,
  Ticket Numbers) and Terminal (the whole Context Bar section): those describe how an individual
  task presents itself, not board layout or terminal cosmetics, so Board stays pure board layout
  and Terminal stays pure terminal cosmetics. The Performance tab holds app-wide rendering:
  Graphics acceleration (Chromium hardware rendering, which the GPU recovery path in
  `src/main/index.ts` turns off after a run the GPU killed) and Animations, which moved from
  Board because it toggles `.no-motion` on `<html>` and was never board chrome. Memory's own
  hardware row stayed put and is named "Model acceleration": it pairs with Search quality as one
  speed-versus-accuracy decision, and the rename is what keeps it distinct from Graphics
  acceleration. Terminal (shell, font, cursor style,
  colors) is global-only, not per-project: shell in particular was never reliably project-scoped
  at the PTY-spawn level (`SessionManager` caches a single `configuredShell` keyed to whichever
  project is currently focused - `src/main/pty/session-manager.ts`), so a background project's
  spawn/resume could silently pick up the wrong shell. There is no Global/Project scope toggle.
  Theme is its own tab, not folded into General, so it has a discoverable sidebar entry distinct
  from Project Location. System tabs are further grouped in the sidebar into three tiers (`tier`
  in `settings-tabs.ts`): Core (Board through Notifications, unlabeled - the default group
  directly under the System header), Advanced (Dictation through Mobile Devices), and Other
  (Privacy, Developer). Tiers must stay contiguous; `settings-tab-scope-parity.test.ts` enforces
  it. A thin full-bleed divider (not just the "System" text label) marks the Project/System
  boundary, since that split is behavioral (System tabs must work with no project open), not just
  organizational. Order within each group (Project; each System tier) is curated by
  frequency/concept, not alphabetical - see the comment above `SETTINGS_TABS` in
  `settings-tabs.ts` for why.
  When adding a new setting, its `tabId` must match its `scope` - see
  `.claude/rules/settings-tab-scope.md`, which is enforced by
  `tests/unit/settings-tab-scope-parity.test.ts`.

### Per-Project Directory
All runtime data lives under `<project>/.kangentic/` (auto-added to `.gitignore` on project
open):
- `config.json` - project config overrides
- `sessions/<claudeSessionId>/` - per-session files (`settings.json`, `status.json`, `activity.json`)
- `worktrees/<slug>/` - git worktree checkouts

### Database
- Global DB (`<configDir>/index.db`) for projects list. configDir is `%APPDATA%/kangentic/`
  (Win), `~/Library/Application Support/kangentic/` (Mac), `~/.config/kangentic/` (Linux)
- Per-project DB (`<configDir>/projects/<projectId>.db`) for tasks, swimlanes, actions, sessions
- Migrations run automatically on open
- **Timestamps** are UTC ISO 8601 strings written via `new Date().toISOString()` (never SQLite
  `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` or naive strings). Display formatting is the renderer's job
  (`src/renderer/lib/datetime.ts`). See `.claude/rules/utc-timestamps.md`.

### Testing

Three test tiers (unit / UI / E2E). Setup, commands, the headless mock, and tier
guidance live in [docs/developer-guide.md](docs/developer-guide.md). The scoped-run discipline
below is the part that must stay in context.

#### The board test gate (Testing and Merge columns)

The expensive and flaky tiers now run on CI as PR checks, not on the local machine. Moving a task
into the **Testing** column runs `/pull-request`: it creates a PR and drives its CI checks (lint,
typecheck, unit, build, the UI shards, and the Linux Electron E2E shards) to all-green, auto-fixing
the code and de-flaking or rewriting tests along the way, then stops without merging. Moving it into
**Merge** runs `/merge-pull-request`: it merges the green PR and fast-forwards the local `main`
checkout for HMR. PRs are the normal path to `main` (CI gates it); `/merge-back` stays a direct
quick-push escape hatch for admins. `/test` is now for **manual local runs** only - it is no longer
wired to a column.

Upstream of both, the **Code Review** column runs `/code-review` as an isolated column agent in the
task's OWN worktree (`isolated` isolates the conversation, not the filesystem - see
[docs/session-lifecycle.md](docs/session-lifecycle.md)). Entering the column suspends the task
agent's session and kills its PTY, so the two never overlap - but it leaves that agent's
UNCOMMITTED work in the shared tree, which is why the review pass commits by set math over
`git status` and never `git add -A`. It auto-fixes findings, adds tests, and commits that pass
itself, so Testing can open on a branch carrying a `*(review)` commit no local agent authored. That is
expected, not corruption. A finished pass normally leaves the tree clean; a fix on an already-dirty
path stays uncommitted by design, so a dirty tree means the pass is either in flight or left those
paths deliberately mixed.

#### When to test

`/test` is the full local gate (typecheck, build, then unit + UI + E2E, all tests, no selection
heuristic), run manually when you want it; `/test quick` runs unit + UI only for the fast inner
loop. Full-tier runs are reserved for the `/test` command or explicit user request. While working on
a task, stay scoped to what you changed - the PR checks are the authoritative full gate.

**Always fine:**
- `npm run typecheck` - run freely at any point.
- Running tests you just added or modified, scoped to those files:
  - `npx vitest run tests/unit/my-new.test.ts`
  - `npx playwright test tests/ui/my-new.spec.ts`
- Single-file validation of an existing test directly affected by your change (same scoped form).

**Never run unless the user explicitly asks, or `/test`, `/pull-request`, or `/merge-back` is executing:**
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:unit` (unscoped vitest)
- `npx vitest run` (no file path)
- `npx playwright test` and `npx playwright test --project=ui` (no spec path)

If a run would execute tests you did not add or modify, it is a full-tier run. Stop and let
`/test` handle it.

**Pre-commit:** `/pull-request` and `/merge-back` run typecheck and lint automatically. Full-tier
validation is CI's job (the PR checks), or the `/test` command for a manual local run.

### Performance

Terminal ownership handoff (one xterm per session, enforced via `dialogSessionIds`), the
activity-log event pipeline (hook -> event-bridge.js -> JSONL -> store, replacing an aggregate
terminal), WebGL rendering with automatic canvas fallback, and 200ms PTY resize debouncing.
Details: [docs/session-lifecycle.md](docs/session-lifecycle.md) and
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Conventions

Enforceable standards live as focused, auto-loaded rules in `.claude/rules/`. Claude Code loads
them into context the way it loads this file: rules without a `paths:` header load every
session; rules with one load when you touch matching files. Each rule names its enforcement (a
`tests/unit/` test that runs in CI, and/or an auditor agent invoked during `/code-review`).

**Always-on rules:**
- `bash-single-command.md` - one command per Bash tool call; no `&&` `||` `|` `;` or redirects.
- `writing-style.md` - no AI tells in authored prose; no em-dashes, en-dashes, `--`, or curly quotes.
- `typescript-style.md` - TypeScript strict mode; no `any` types; full descriptive names.
- `no-personal-info.md` - no usernames, emails, machine paths, client names, or request origins in committed files (repo is public).

**Path-scoped rules (load with their subsystem):**
- `task-lifecycle-lock.md` - wrap per-task async mutation in `withTaskLock`.
- `hmr-patterns.md` - dev-mode HMR parity patterns A through D.
- `ui-conventions.md` - shared primitives, font floor, no hover-only controls, the 900x600 floor, brief copy.
- `popover-escapes-clipping.md` - a menu popover portals to `document.body` with `strategy: 'fixed'`; `z-index` never escapes an overflow clip.
- `light-dismiss-denylist.md` - clicking outside a task window closes it; overlays mount outside the `data-dismiss-layer` subtree.
- `synchronous-shutdown.md` - the `before-quit` path is synchronous; only the bounded PTY exit drain may `preventDefault`.
- `utc-timestamps.md` - DB writes use `new Date().toISOString()`.
- `guarded-sync-writes.md` - a synchronous write is routed through `safeWriteJson` or marked `// sync-write-ok:` with a reason.
- `ipc-7-layer-parity.md` - wire an IPC endpoint through all 7 layers.
- `project-scoped-ipc.md` - renderer-driven task/session mutations forward an explicit interaction-time `projectId`.
- `esbuild-cjs-imports.md` - ES `import`, not bare `require()`, in bundled main/preload code.
- `dependency-block-parity.md` - `dependencies` is the esbuild externals plus what `electron-builder.yml` names; everything bundled is a devDependency.
- `agent-adapters-boundary.md` - no agent-name branching outside `src/main/agent/adapters/`.
- `automation-adapters.md` - an automation type is declared once in `AUTOMATION_MANIFEST`; the runner owns escaping, timeouts, and retry.
- `cli-features-over-custom-layers.md` - do not shadow an agent CLI's native controls.
- `dev-tooling-build-exclusion.md` - dev tooling is build-excluded via `__KANGENTIC_DEV__`.
- `docs-stay-in-sync.md` - update docs when changing anchor source files (types, IPC, migrations, adapters, settings).
- `protocol-release-parity.md` - every `protocol-v*` tag needs a `CHANGELOG.md` entry; never hand-tag a protocol release.
- `skill-authoring.md` - when to fork a skill and how to route agents.
- `board-config-parity.md` - team-shared swimlane fields round-trip to `kangentic.json`.
- `external-scripts-parity.md` - unbundled bridge/plugin scripts register in `EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS` and are copied by both `build.js` and `dev.js`.
- `activity-state-classification.md` - bucket `ActivityState` idle-vs-active only via `src/shared/activity-state.ts`.
- `activity-marks.md` - marks come from `@kangentic/branding` via `ActivityMark`; composited motion only; `IconSlot` for element-type swaps.
- `command-terminal.md` - slot-keyed windows, global geometry against per-project population, and a reattach that never checks out.
- `board-completing-task-chokepoint.md` - hide in-flight Done-completing tasks at KanbanBoard's `tasksPerLane`, never per-lane.
- `keybindings-registry.md` - shortcuts declared in `KEYBINDINGS` and bound via `useKeybinding`, not ad-hoc keydown listeners.
- `keyboard-drag-intent.md` - `IntentKeyboardSensor` is the only dnd-kit keyboard sensor, and it arms only on Tab-placed focus.
- `restore-no-animation-replay.md` - a project switch or restore paints flat: no entrance replay, no value pulse.
- `cross-platform-parity.md` - code and tests behave identically on Windows/macOS/Linux/CI.
- `browser-automation-driver.md` - one shipped CDP driver; every `kangentic_browser_*` tool routes through `withGuest`.
- `mcp-tool-list-parity.md` - every registered MCP tool stays in sync with `MCP_TOOL_MANIFEST` and `docs/mcp-server.md`.
- `mcp-column-field-parity.md` - every `Swimlane` field is a parameter of both MCP column tools, or classified unexposed with a reason.
- `central-embedding-engine.md` - only `embed-engine.ts` embeds; call sites index and `markDirty()`, never embed inline.
- `dictation-out-of-process.md` - `sherpa-onnx-node` is imported only inside the `kangentic-dictation` utilityProcess worker.
- `pop-out-surface-registry.md` - every `BrowserWindow` comes from `createWindow` or the pop-out manager, through the registries.
- `spawn-entry-point-parity.md` - every agent spawn routes through `spawnAgent` / `prepareAgentSpawn` and `runSpawnPreamble`.
- `linux-package-dependencies.md` - rpm dependencies are soname capabilities, never package names.
- `release-gates-fail-loudly.md` - a release-path step that guarantees something fails loudly when it cannot.
- `task-template-vars-parity.md` - promptTemplate keywords are declared once in `TASK_TEMPLATE_VARS`.
- `settings-tab-scope.md` - a setting's tab must match its persistence scope.
- `derived-detail-ownership.md` - task-detail ownership is a host's COMPLETE mounted set, reconciled, never accumulated.
- `retained-pane-never-remounts.md` - a window with an open Browser pane is RETAINED across a project switch; hide it with `opacity: 0`.
- `terminal-arrival-focus.md` - an arriving terminal never decides its own focus; route it through `mayTakeArrivalFocus`.
- `agent-driven-focus.md` - an agent-driven pane SHOWS its focus move, and the driver never takes guest focus itself.
- `xterm-unicode11-parity.md` - every xterm `Terminal` activates Unicode 11 widths; hand-rolled parsers use `wcwidthV11`.
- `cookie-jar-sharing.md` - jar cookies are copied only through `cookie-seed.ts`, and partitions stay task-keyed.
- `pty-teardown-grace.md` - a young agent's PTY is never force-killed without its exit sequence and the 1500 ms grace.
- `web-demo-parity.md` - the web build is the real renderer over the mock bridge; every `ElectronAPI` method has a mock.
- `session-replica-contract.md` - the renderer session store is a replica of main's registry, and a removal is its own push.

**Local overrides:** there is no per-rule local file. Put machine-specific instruction
overrides in a gitignored `CLAUDE.local.md` at the project root.

**Other conventions (workflow, not extracted to rules):**
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- When adding or updating tests, use the `/test` command to ensure correct tier classification.
- A plain **local commit** (snapshot work in progress, protect changes before `/preview`) goes
  through `/commit`: it stages and commits on the current branch only, with no push and no
  rebase. A bare request to "commit" / "commit changes" means `/commit`, never `/merge-back`.
- **Landing changes goes through a PR by default.** The board drives it: the **Testing** column runs
  `/pull-request` (commit, conventional branch, push, create the PR, drive its CI checks to green),
  and the **Merge** column runs `/merge-pull-request` (merge the green PR, pull back to local
  `main`). For a deliberate direct quick-push that bypasses the PR gate (admin only - CI is down, a
  one-line hotfix), use `/merge-back`. Only push, land, or merge when the user explicitly asks.
- `/commit`, `/pull-request`, `/merge-pull-request`, and `/merge-back` all write conventional-commit
  messages.
- `/sync-docs` keeps `docs/` aligned with source; the doc-anchor check runs inside `/pull-request`
  (commit time) and `/merge-pull-request` (merge time), and `/merge-back` for direct pushes.

### Authoring a rule

When you codify a new convention, add it as a `.claude/rules/*.md` file following the existing
ones (e.g. `board-config-parity.md`):

1. **One concern per file**, with a descriptive kebab-case filename.
2. **Decide loading, and measure what it costs.** Always-on rules (no frontmatter) load every
   session, so reserve them for universal, file-independent conventions (tool use, house style,
   security); we run 4, totalling about 12k characters. Everything subsystem-specific gets
   `paths:` frontmatter so it loads only when a matching file enters context. The number to
   watch is not that always-on count but the union an ordinary edit pulls in, because a rule
   scoped to `src/renderer/**` matches nearly every renderer file: measured on 2026-09-21, a
   board-card edit loads 129k characters of CLAUDE.md plus rules, a PTY edit 65k.
   `node scripts/measure-rule-load.js` prints it per subsystem (`--verbose` names each rule).
   Run it when you add a rule or widen a glob. If your change moves a subsystem's number a lot,
   narrow the glob or split the rule rather than accepting it. This is a procedure, not a gate:
   there is no measured point at which the union starts hurting, so a pass/fail threshold would
   be invented. The one real gate is on CLAUDE.md alone, where the harness supplies the limit.
3. **Mind the read-trigger gap.** A path-scoped rule loads when a matching file is *read into
   context*, not when Claude *creates* a new file in that path. So (a) any convention that must
   hold at file-creation time (universal style, security) belongs in an always-on rule, a lint
   rule, or a hook, never path-scoped-only; and (b) every path-scoped rule should have a CI
   backstop (a `tests/unit/` test, an ESLint rule, or a review-time auditor agent) so a missed
   load is still caught.
4. **Structure:** a one-paragraph context (the problem / the bug it prevents), `## The rule`
   (prescriptive), `## Enforcement (self-maintaining)`, and `## Scope`.
5. **Name an enforcement, strongest available.** A `PreToolUse` hook blocks 100%; a `tests/unit/`
   check or ESLint rule both run in CI; a review-time auditor agent or `/code-review` is the
   probabilistic fallback. Flag explicitly where mechanical coverage is missing. Do not stack
   three redundant enforcers on one rule.
6. **Update the index above** with a one-line pointer, and add a backlink from the enforcing
   agent or skill so the rule stays the single source of truth.
7. **Scaling.** Rules are discovered recursively, so when the flat list grows large, group them
   into `.claude/rules/<subsystem>/` subdirectories (e.g. `frontend/`, `backend/`). There is no
   per-rule local override; machine-specific overrides go in `CLAUDE.local.md`.

**Linting:** `npm run lint` runs `eslint src/ --max-warnings 0` in CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so ESLint rules (`no-explicit-any`, `no-require-imports`, etc.)
are enforced on every push. No warnings are tolerated: `--max-warnings 0` makes ANY warning
(including `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`) fail the lint check, so warnings can never silently
accumulate. Fix a warning properly where the dependency is safe to add (stable refs, Zustand
actions) or restructure (wrap an unstable `?? {}`/`?? []` fallback in `useMemo`); only when an
omission is deliberate, suppress that one line with `// eslint-disable-next-line
react-hooks/exhaustive-deps -- <reason>` and a concrete reason. Use a `tests/unit/` check for
conventions ESLint cannot express (em-dashes, IPC and board-config parity, ...).

**This file has a size budget.** `tests/unit/rules-index-parity.test.ts` fails when CLAUDE.md
passes 40,000 characters, the point Claude Code warns at. It loads into every session and every
subagent's fixed floor, so when it grows, move the newest weight out instead of raising the
number: prescriptive content into a path-scoped `.claude/rules/*.md`, and background,
measurements, and rejected alternatives into `docs/`. Leave a pointer line behind.
