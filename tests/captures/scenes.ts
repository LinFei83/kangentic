/**
 * The scene registry: one catalog, two consumers.
 *
 * The web build (demo/) resolves `view=<name>` through this map at boot with no driver, and the
 * capture rig (tests/captures/features/scenes.capture.ts) opens the same names in the BUILT demo
 * with Playwright behind it. Every entry is DATA on top of the sample install in
 * helpers/demo-dataset.ts: config overrides, task-row patches, session activity states,
 * `window.__mock*` seeds the mock reads, and a short list of steps the consumer plays before it
 * reveals the frame. No code travels through a scene, so the same shape can ride a `state=` URL
 * parameter verbatim.
 *
 * `reach` says who can build the scene:
 *   state   config and rows alone; nothing is clicked
 *   boot    state plus a few pre-reveal clicks (the demo runs them; the rig runs them too)
 *   driver  needs a hover, a drag, or an open menu; the capture rig only, the demo refuses it
 *
 * Three fields ship past this repo. `alt` is the reader-facing text a docs figure carries, so it is
 * authored here, beside the state it describes, and emitted into `dist/demo/scenes.json`. `ready`
 * is the selector that must exist before the frame counts as built: the demo waits for it before
 * it reveals and posts ready, the smoke tier asserts it, and the rig shoots after it. `focus`, when
 * set, names the element whose rect the ready message reports, so a host can crop a dialog scene
 * to the dialog without knowing the layout.
 *
 * No Node imports on purpose: demo/vite.config.mts serializes this module into the static build,
 * and the capture rig reads it as well. tests/unit/scene-registry.test.ts pins the shape.
