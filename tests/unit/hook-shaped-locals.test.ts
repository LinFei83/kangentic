/**
 * No `use`-prefixed LOCAL variables in renderer components.
 *
 * react-refresh's Babel transform treats a call to any identifier starting with
 * `use` as a custom hook, and records it in the component's refresh signature so
 * it can tell whether a hot update may preserve state. A signature entry has to
 * resolve to a stable binding; a local variable cannot, so the transform falls
 * back to `forceReset: true` - and React then REMOUNTS the component on every
 * Fast Refresh of its module instead of preserving its state.
 *
 * That is invisible in almost every component (a remount just re-runs effects),
 * which is why `const useStore = useLayerStore()` survived review five times. It
 * is not invisible in the window manager: a remounted task-detail window rebuilds
 * its Browser pane, an Electron `<webview>` guest dies with its DOM node, and the
 * browser an agent was driving is destroyed - with no page reload and no Fast
 * Refresh bailout to point at. See `.claude/rules/hmr-patterns.md`, and measure
 * with `scripts/hmr-guest-probe.mjs`.
 *
 * MODULE-SCOPE `use*` consts are the legitimate case (`export const useBoardStore =
 * create(...)`) and are not matched: the scan looks only at INDENTED declarations,
 * which is what makes a binding local.
