 * no renderer-side surface descriptor - so routing it through the pop-out

 * It has its own lifecycle (owned by the agent session that opened it) and its
 * own synchronous teardown, in BOTH `shutdown.ts` and the main window's
 * `closed` handler - the second is not redundant: an offscreen window still
 * counts in `getAllWindows()`, so a lane outliving the main window stops
 * `window-all-closed` firing and `shutdown.ts` then never runs at all. Adding a
