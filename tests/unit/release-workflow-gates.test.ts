// A gate that stops gating without saying so is worse than no gate, because it still reads as
// coverage. release.yml has been bitten by that four times now. The first two shapes are below;
// the later describe blocks pin the published-release re-run (v0.39.0) and the two upgrade-gate
// baselines (v0.39.0 upgrading from itself, v0.39.x downgrading from v0.40.0).
//
// The subtle one is the status-check function. GitHub normally skips a job when anything in its
// `needs:` failed, but naming always(), cancelled(), or failure() in the `if:` replaces that
// implied success() gate, so a job listed in `needs:` and NOT also named in the `if:` still runs
// when its dependency FAILED. release.yml carries always() on two jobs to tolerate the conditional
// create-tag and `!cancelled()` on the two publish jobs, the demo deploy, and the poster job, which
// means every future `needs:` entry added to any of the six has to be repeated in the `if:` by
// hand. The comment above create-draft-release warns about this; this test is what makes the
// warning binding.
//
// The blunt one is a gate simply going missing: preflight-symbols exists because v0.37.0 and
// v0.38.0 both shipped with zero sourcemaps and zero native debug files, the KANGENTIC_SENTRY_TOKEN
// secret never having been created. The build no-opped in total silence and every job reported
// success. Deleting that job, or unhooking it from the draft, would restore that exact hole.
//
// Follows release-asset-manifest.test.ts in regex-extracting YAML rather than adding a parser
// (js-yaml is only transitively present, not a declared dependency).
//
