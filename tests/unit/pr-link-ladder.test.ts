 * branch -> remote tip), write-only-on-change, the TTL coalesce + terminal-skip
 * throttle (force bypasses), and transient-error surfacing that preserves an
 * existing link.
 *
 * The connectors, simple-git, and project-repos are mocked so the core logic is
 * tested in isolation (no gh CLI, no native DB).
 *
 * Every task is built by one of the builders below, each of which produces a
 * state the product actually writes. The suite once handed the ladder
 * `worktree_path: null` with `branch_name: 'slug'` and `use_worktree: 1` and
 * called that "no worktree"; that pairing exists only after a Done move
 * captures the branch, and a task created with `useWorktree: false` (which has
 * no branch, no sha, and until the push capture no anchor at all) was never
 * tested. The tiers written for it passed against inputs the app cannot
