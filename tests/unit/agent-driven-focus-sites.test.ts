/**
 * Static guard for `.claude/rules/agent-driven-focus.md`.
 *
 * The policy tests elsewhere prove the arbiter and the guard make the right
 * DECISIONS. Nothing proved that every path an agent can reach actually asks
 * them, and that is where this bug class lives: `kangentic_browser_open_pane`
 * arrives as an ordinary IPC push, indistinguishable from the user's own card
 * click, so a renderer that opens a window off that push and forgets to declare
 * the origin silently hands the agent the user's keyboard.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. Writing this scan is what found the Agent Monitor
 * path: `useMonitorDetailOwnership` is a SECOND host for the same `onOpenHere`
 * push, and it opened its window unstamped - so an agent-opened detail that
 * landed on the monitor instead of the board took focus exactly as before the
 * fix, on the one path the board-side fix did not cover.
 *
 * The scan cannot decide agent-vs-user for a shared push (the rule says so
 * explicitly). What it CAN do is refuse to let the question go unanswered: a
 * file that both subscribes to a push and opens a window must either thread the
 * origin through, or carry an `// agent-focus-ok: <reason>` marker where a human
 * made the call.
 *
 * Tier: Unit (vitest, static scan).
