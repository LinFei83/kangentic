/**
 * Resilient app teardown for E2E afterAll hooks.
 *
 * Wraps `app.close()` in a 25-second race. If Electron's graceful shutdown
 * stalls (e.g. a hung PTY child blocks before-quit under CI load, or a worker
 * process crash leaves the app without its IPC pipe), this helper force-kills
 * the Electron process tree instead of letting the afterAll hook time out and
 * fail the entire worker (the CI failure mode this was written to fix).
 *
 * The 25s budget is chosen to be well within the project-level 45s test
 * timeout: a graceful shutdown rarely exceeds 5-8s, so 25s gives Electron
 * ample time for a clean exit while still leaving 20s margin for the timeout
 * budget and any subsequent afterAll cleanup (temp-dir removal, etc.).
 *
 * Normal path cost: zero. `Promise.race` resolves as soon as `app.close()`
 * settles, which is before the timeout promise even schedules its callback in
 * the normal case. The timeout promise is created unconditionally but never
 * resolves on the fast path.
 *
 * Force-kill is cross-platform:
 *   - Windows: `taskkill /PID <pid> /T /F` (walks the child tree, matches
 *     the existing janitor / zombie-reaper pattern in electron-janitor.ts and
 *     src/main/git/zombie-reaper.ts).
 *   - POSIX (Linux/macOS): `process.kill(pid, 'SIGKILL')`. Chromium GPU and
 *     network-utility children receive SIGTERM from the kernel when the main
 *     dies (they are not tree-killed explicitly on POSIX, but those children
 *     self-exit when their parent is gone). This is the same behavior as the
 *     global teardown janitor on Linux CI.
 *
 * This is a TEST-SIDE fix only. It does not touch any product shutdown code
 * in src/main/ (the synchronous before-quit path is intentionally synchronous
 * per .claude/rules/synchronous-shutdown.md).

 * (`\x1b[2J`) after any printable output - and, the moment that clear streams
 * through `onData()`, stamps `tuiStartIndex` at that byte offset so
 * `getScrollback()` strips everything before it. This is EAGER (fires on
 * write, inside `onData`), not a lazily-cached read-time scan: once that
 * clear has been written into the buffer, every `getScrollback()` call from
 * then on - no matter when it happens - returns the stripped view. This is
 * intentional production behavior (it hides pre-TUI shell noise from the
 * replay), but it means an agent whose startup marker prints BEFORE its
 * TUI's first repaint (Codex and Cursor both print `MOCK_*_SESSION:<id>`
 * before their `MOCK_*_TUI_REDRAWS` mock's first `\x1b[2J`, on a fixed
 * ~500ms interval) only has a marker readable in scrollback during the
 * window between spawn and that first clear landing. A scrollback-marker
 * poll that happens to make its first successful read inside that window
 * passes immediately; one whose setup (or first poll tick) pushes past that
 * window - e.g. under CI load - finds the marker already and permanently
 * stripped, and spins for its full timeout even though the session spawned
 * successfully. That reads exactly like a spawn-timing race (intermittent,
 * worse under load, full-timeout failure with an instant pass on retry's
 * fresh session/buffer) but is actually racing a fixed mock redraw timer,
 * not spawn completion. Session existence via IPC is unaffected by that
 * stripping, so it is the durable signal here.
