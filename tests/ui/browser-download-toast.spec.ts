/**
 * UI test for the Browser-pane download toast (useBrowserDownloadToast.ts).
 *
 * A pane's `<webview>` saves a triggered download straight to the OS Downloads
 * folder (the Chrome behavior, and the only thing that makes downloads work
 * at all for the human using the pane). Silently is the wrong default here:
 * an agent driving the pane can trigger a download the user never asked for,
 * so main pushes BROWSER_DOWNLOAD_DONE and this hook toasts it - a success
 * toast with a "Show in folder" action for a completed download, and a plain
 * warning naming the file for anything that didn't finish.
 *
 * The hook is mounted unconditionally in WindowLayer's BoardBridges (see
 * AppLayout.tsx: `<WindowLayer />` sits outside the `currentProject ?` branch),
 * so no project needs to be open for it to fire - this spec drives it straight
 * off a bare app boot via window.__mockBrowser.emitDownloadDone(), which
 * mock-electron-api.js exposes but nothing exercised before this file.
 *
 * See docs/embedded-browser.md decision 13 and
 * src/renderer/window-manager/bridge/useBrowserDownloadToast.ts.
