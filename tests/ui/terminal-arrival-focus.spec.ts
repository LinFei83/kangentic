/**
 * Regression spec: a background terminal must not steal keyboard focus from a
 * just-opened task detail.
 *
 * The bug. Opening a task detail claims that task's session, so the bottom panel
 * drops its tab and falls back to a DIFFERENT running session, mounting a fresh
 * terminal for it moments after the detail window mounts its own. Both then fetch
 * scrollback, which real main delays 150-400ms while the agent TUI's repaint
 * settles, and both used to end in an unconditional `xterm.focus()`. Whichever
 * replay resolved LAST won, so the user opened a task, started typing, and the
 * keystrokes went to whatever agent the panel happened to fall back to. The
 * reported case typed `/compact` into the wrong session.
 *
 * Why the ordering has to be forced. The defect only appears when the background
 * terminal's replay resolves AFTER the detail's, which in production is a genuine
 * race. `window.__mockScrollbackDelayMs` (see `getScrollback` in
 * mock-electron-api.js) pins that order so spec 1 tests the losing case every
 * run rather than half the time. Spec 3 (`launch({ delayFallbackReplay: false
 * })`) leaves it off: its claim is checked against the panel's OWN re-expand
 * arrival, which does not depend on which of the detail's or the panel's
 * initial mounts resolves first, and the delay would only spend wall clock
 * inside `claimArrivalFocus`'s fixed, non-retrying TTL window for no reason
 * that spec needs. Spec 2 leaves the default on; the delay is inert there too
 * (it never asserts on the fallback session), so there is nothing to gain by
 * touching it.
 *
 * Why the waits are causal, not timed. `TerminalTab` renders
 * `data-testid="terminal-replay-veil"` until its scrollback settles, so a pane's
 * veil disappearing IS that pane's replay resolving. `settleScrollback` runs one
 * frame before the focus call it guards, so waiting for the veil to clear lands
 * exactly where the steal used to happen. No `waitForTimeout` anywhere
 * (.claude/rules/cross-platform-parity.md).
 *
 * How to verify RED / GREEN:
 *  - Spec 1: drop either arrival gate - the `mayTakeArrivalFocusRef` check in
 *    `useTerminal.ts`'s mount-replay frame, or the `mayFocusOnArrival()` check in
 *    `TerminalTab.tsx`'s active effect - and the delayed panel replay takes focus,
 *    failing the final two assertions.
 *  - Spec 2: remove the `claimArrivalFocus` call from `selectActiveSession` in
 *    `session-store.ts` and the clicked tab's terminal never gets focus, because
 *    the arbiter resolves the still-focused detail window instead.
 *  - Spec 3: remove the `claimArrivalFocus` call from `onToggleCollapse` in
 *    `useTerminalResize.ts` and the re-expanded panel's terminal never gets focus,
 *    for the same reason. That claim looks redundant until you notice `showContent`
 *    gates whether the panel mounts a `TerminalTab` at all, so an expand IS an
 *    arrival.

/**
 * Spec 4: an arrival whose replay is PRE-EMPTED still gets its focus decision.
 *
 * `useTerminal`'s scrollback watchdog (SCROLLBACK_WATCHDOG_MS, 5s) is a backstop
 * for a replay that never completes. When it fires it bumps the replay
 * generation, which makes that replay's own `afterWrite` return ABOVE the frame
 * which asks the arbiter - so the arrival-focus decision is cancelled - and it
 * clears `scrollbackPendingRef`, which lifts the replay veil. To everything
 * downstream the terminal has finished arriving. In fact nothing ever asked
 * whether it may take focus, and nothing asks again, so that terminal is
 * unfocusable for the rest of its life.
 *
 * Why this drives the RELOAD path rather than a fresh mount. On a solo mount
 * `TerminalTab`'s own init frame (the `mayFocusOnArrival('tab-init')` call in its
 * `active` effect) runs one frame after the init queue constructs the terminal,
 * and focuses it long before the watchdog - so a mount-based version of this spec
 * would pass with the fix reverted, i.e. vacuously. Lifting the launch overlay on
 * an ALREADY-INITIALIZED terminal produces an arrival with no `tab-init` frame at
 * all (`TerminalTab`'s `terminalReady` false -> true effect calls
 * `reloadScrollback()` with no `skipFocus`), so the pre-empted decision is the
 * only one there is. That is what makes this red-green.
 *
 * The tab click before the delay is what puts a live claim in place. Without it
 * the still-focused detail window wins tier 2 and the terminal is denied for a
 * legitimate reason, which would also pass vacuously.
 *
 * How to verify RED / GREEN: drop the `focusOnArrival('replay-watchdog')` call
 * from `armScrollbackWatchdog` in `useTerminal.ts` and this fails with the
 * production symptom - pane mounted, veil gone, textarea never focused.
