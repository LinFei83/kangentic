# Rule: an agent never takes the user's keyboard focus silently

The `kangentic_browser_*` tools drive the user's own running app, on the user's own screen, while
the user is doing something else. Two paths took the keyboard mid-keystroke, and neither was a bug
in the tool's own logic.

Measured on Electron 41 against a live guest, with the terminal focused in an OS-focused window:
one `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` moved `document.activeElement` from the terminal's
`xterm-helper-textarea` to the `<webview>` and flipped `document.hasFocus()` to false. The guest
took REAL focus, so the rest of what the user was typing went into the page. Separately,
`kangentic_browser_open_pane` opened a task-detail window, which set `focusedWindowId`, which made
`resolveArrivalFocus`'s tier 2 match for that window - so its arriving terminal legitimately took
focus out of the terminal the user was actually in. Both were the absence of a rule saying an
agent's actions are not the user's.

## The rule

**An agent action never moves the user's keyboard focus invisibly or unboundedly.** Split by case,
because one of the three cannot be eliminated and the honest rule says so:

- A window open never moves focus. A mount-time `autoFocus` never moves focus.
- A CDP click DOES move focus into the guest, unavoidably: that is how a page gets focused at all,
  and it is the same mechanism a user's own click uses. That case is bounded to the burst, SHOWN
  while it lasts, restored when it ends, and any keystroke the user makes meanwhile is routed to
  their terminal rather than the page.
- The driver never takes guest focus on its own, outside a click.

This is the browser-side analogue of [[terminal-arrival-focus]]'s "an arriving terminal never
decides its own focus", and it holds across the main/renderer boundary. Where it differs is that a
terminal's arrival is always deferrable, and a click's focus effect is not - so this rule bounds and
reveals what that one cannot avoid.

- **The driver NEVER takes the guest's keyboard focus.** Focus moves only as the side effect of a
  synthesized click, and the renderer guard hands it back. This is the KISS position, and it was
  reached by building the alternative and measuring it.

  An implementation that acquired guest focus for interact drives (`focusGuestFromEmbedder`, an
  awaited `executeJavaScript` round trip that focused the `<webview>` element) existed for one day.
  Against a live guest it put the agent's OWN text into the user's terminal: 28 characters, then 95,
  then 207, as each mitigation was added. A `<webview>` is an out-of-process iframe, so acquiring
  its focus is asynchronous and never atomic - the embedder's `document.activeElement` becomes the
  `<webview>` while the real widget focus is still crossing the process boundary, and anything
  dispatched in that gap goes to whichever widget still holds focus. Every version of holding focus
  across calls is a race with the user, who can take it back mid-dispatch. Do not rebuild it.

  Two related facts, both measured, worth keeping:

  - `webContents.focus()` **cannot focus a guest at all.** Electron early-returns for one, to avoid
    a fatal NOTREACHED in `WebContentsViewChildFrame` (`electron_api_web_contents.cc`).
  - `Emulation.setFocusEmulationEnabled` does not affect input ROUTING. Measured in the guest:
    `document.hasFocus()` was `true` while keys were being dropped. It changes what the page
    BELIEVES, which is worth having - a page that hides UI or pauses on blur behaves normally under
    automation - but it is not what makes a keystroke land. Do **not** hoist that call into
    `attachDebugger`: the dev inspection bridge attaches through the same function against
    Kangentic's OWN window (`src/devtools/install.ts`), where a permanently-focused page changes
    `document.hasFocus()` under the app itself.

  The consequence: `kangentic_browser_type` and `_keypress` WITHOUT a selector work only while the
  pane already holds focus, and are REFUSED otherwise (next bullet). The selector forms work
  because the click and the characters happen inside ONE call, which is the only configuration
  that measured clean. It is recorded in `docs/embedded-browser.md`.
- **A key the pane would not receive is REFUSED, never sent.** Chromium delivers a CDP key to
  whatever widget holds focus in the window, not to the guest it was sent to. So between calls,
  with focus handed back to the user's terminal, a selector-less key goes to that TERMINAL. It is
  not dropped. An agent's `keypress Escape` interrupted the agent that sent it (task #720).
  Measured with a standalone probe on Electron 41: the agent's keys arrived at the stand-in terminal
  as trusted keydowns, and the guest's `before-input-event` fired zero times. That interception path
  is not involved, and a cross-site iframe changes nothing.

  `dispatchKeyEvent` (`src/main/browser/cdp/cdp.ts`) checks `keyboardFocusIsInHost`
  (`cdp/keyboard-focus.ts`) before EVERY key event and throws `KeyboardFocusNotInGuestError`
  instead of sending. `withGuest` reports that as `pane-not-focused`. The check reads
  `hostWebContents.focusedFrame`, and it runs in the same turn as `sendCommand`, so focus cannot move
  in between. Keep it at that chokepoint and synchronous. Do not replace it with a renderer probe,
  which crosses a process boundary. Do not use `guest.isFocused()` or `getFocusedWebContents()`
  either: the probe showed neither tells the cases apart. The check only READS focus, so it is not
  a return of the focus acquisition above.
- **The focus move is SHOWN, not hidden, and it is shown ON THE PAGE.** This is the design, and it
  is what the three failed attempts above were replaced with. While a burst is open the pane takes
  a veil, an accent border, and a static "Agent is driving" label in its bottom-left corner.
  `agent-drive-store.ts` holds the state, keyed by sessionId; `BrowserPane` owns the translation
  from the guest id the signal carries, because it is the only component that knows both.

  **The terminal is never touched.** It faded to 40% until 2026-09-21, on the reasoning that the
  focus move should be visible, and that was aimed at the wrong half of the split. Main intercepts
  every keyDown at the guest and writes it to the terminal, so the terminal is the surface that
  still accepts the user's typing and the PAGE is the one that cannot take a keystroke. Dimming the
  terminal faded the working half while the inert half stayed bright. Do not reintroduce it, and do
  not put a status strip, a notice or a label there either: the terminal stays unobstructed.

  **The MOTION is the primary cue, and the veil supports it.** Reported from a live drive: "on a
  white background the dim isn't coming through". It was coming through - the veil was applied and
  measurable. A viewer simply cannot tell a veiled white page from a page that is grey, because
  they never see the two side by side. **A tint needs a baseline; motion does not.** So the inset
  ring breathes (`.kng-drive-pulse`, opacity, 1400ms, the activity marks' shared period so a driving
  pane is in lockstep with every other working indicator rather than adding a cadence), and the
  label's dot breathes with it.

  The RING carries the motion, not the 6px dot alone. The activity marks learned that the expensive
  way: a 2.7px element blinking reads as no motion at all. The ring is the page's whole perimeter
  and covers no content, so it can move without making anything harder to read.

  Colour is not the whole signal on purpose: the veil is a luminance change rather than a hue, and
  the label is what makes "why has my typing stopped appearing" answerable in words. Neither the
  veil nor the motion alone would do - a dimmed or pulsing surface is the universal look for
  loading, and this is not that.

  **The pointer block is a SEPARATE layer from the announcement, on the RAW signal.** They answer
  different questions and must not share an envelope. The mark asks "should the pane still be
  marked", and its tail deliberately outlives the last call so a run does not strobe. The block
  asks "is the agent driving right now", and has to be exact in both directions: it cannot lag the
  first call, and it must not outlive the last one by five seconds holding a page the agent has
  finished with. When they shared one envelope the first call of every run went unguarded for a
  whole inter-call gap.

  The blocking layer carries the accent ring, so the pane is never silently dead: a page that stops
  taking clicks with nothing on screen to explain it is worse than a brief mark. An edge rather
  than a wash, so a short block reads as a pulse at the border. The ring only BREATHES once the
  run is announced, so motion still means sustained control.

  The announcement layer must never take the pointer. It sits above the block, so if it captured,
  it would keep swallowing clicks through its fade after the block had let go.

  **The guest's own event capture goes with the block.** A `<webview>` does not reliably honour CSS
  stacking, so a scrim on top of it is not enough on its own: the guest's `pointerEvents` has to go
  to `none` too, exactly as draw mode already does.

  This is a correctness fix, not only honesty about the veil. Clicking into the page during a drive
  used to strand the user's typing: the click is a gesture away from the guarded element, so the
  renderer's guard disarms and `restoreTarget` goes null, while main is still unconditionally
  preventDefaulting every keyDown at the guest. Keystrokes then reached neither the page nor the
  terminal and were dropped in silence. With the pointer swallowed that state is unreachable. It
  also stops a click racing the agent, which changes the page under a verification in progress.

  The cost is accepted and should stay written down: the page cannot be scrolled while a run is
  open. The toolbar is outside the overlay container and stays live throughout (Close browser, the
  note input, Draw, Inspect), and a run closes on its own timer, so a stuck veil cannot lock the
  pane away permanently.

  The interception stays as the safety net underneath, so a user who types anyway still lands in
  their terminal rather than a web form. Visible state and safe routing are complements here, not
  alternatives.
- **The visual runs on a shaped envelope whose unit is the RUN, never the burst.** `isAgentDriving`
  is tight because it decides where a keystroke goes: it opens on the first call and closes
  `DRIVE_BURST_QUIET_MS` (400ms) after the last. `useAgentDriveVeil` is the shaping layer, and
  every consumer reads it - the pane's veil and the split row's accent border both call the hook,
  because shaping only one leaves the other flipping at the raw cadence underneath it.

  **Measured, from a real 27-call agent verification against a live pane** (the agent's own
  transcript timestamps):

  | | min | median | max |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | one call holds the guest | 253ms | 272ms | 929ms |
  | gap between consecutive calls | 1060ms | 1665ms | 4428ms |

  Both rows matter and the second is the surprising one. A call holds the guest about a quarter of
  a second, so one call is a signal roughly 670ms long. And the gap between calls is never under a
  second, because it is the MODEL THINKING rather than the tool running - so the 400ms quiet window
  never bridges it and **every call is its own burst**. Ten calls an agent issues "back to back"
  arrive as ten bursts about 1.1s apart.

  A per-burst envelope therefore has no good setting: paint each burst and a routine verification
  flashes 27 times, suppress short bursts and nothing ever paints because every burst is short.
  A first attempt used a 700ms grace chosen to sit just above the single-call band; 26 of 27 calls
  fell under it and the user saw nothing at all. Do not reintroduce a per-burst threshold.

  **Four requirements, and every earlier cut satisfied three of them.** Stated by the user: show
  the agent is working as soon as possible; block the user's input as soon as possible; release
  both as soon as the agent is no longer using the pane; never flash or flicker.

  The tension is only between the first and the last, and only if "no flicker" is read as "never
  appear briefly". It is not. What was reported was ONE cue strobing 27 times across a single piece
  of work. So the cure is holding across the gaps, not delaying the start, and once that is right
  the first requirement is free.

  So: the veil OPENS on the first burst with no threshold, HOLDS while bursts keep arriving within
  `LINK_MS` (5000ms, above the widest gap measured), and CLOSES on the earliest honest signal - the
  agent going idle, the user's Ctrl+C, or `LINK_MS` of silence. A whole verification is one fade in
  and one fade out.

  A second-burst threshold was tried and removed: it made the announcement trail the agent by a
  whole inter-call gap, and it put the mark out of step with the pointer block, which cannot wait.
  Do not reintroduce one.

  Consumers own the fade: 200ms in, and the exit depends on WHY the run ended. A run that wound
  down (the link window expired) fades over 500ms, which reads as an ending rather than as
  something abruptly gone. A run the user STOPPED fades in 100ms, because they pressed the key and
  are waiting to see that it landed. The hook reports which through `stopped`; the two are
  identical in the store and nothing alike to the person watching.

  That split came from a report of the release "still feeling slow" against a release whose state
  flip and pointer restore were both already instant. Only the fade was left - and for that half
  second the veil was telling the user not to touch a page that was fully clickable again, which is
  the visual contradicting the behaviour rather than merely lagging it. Do not fix that by
  shortening BOTH: the slow wind-down is still right for the case nobody triggered.

  Easing instead of suppressing was rejected outright - a fade on a cue that should never have
  appeared is a slower flash, and a slower flash occupies more time on screen, not less. Under
  reduced motion, drop the fades and keep every timing: the run rule is scheduling rather than
  animation, and it is the part that removes the churn.

  **A stop bypasses the envelope entirely, and the user's Ctrl+C does not wait for the engine.**
  The link window exists to bridge the model THINKING between two calls, so an interrupted or
  finished agent must never wait it out: the hook watches the session and closes the run at once
  when it stops running or its activity becomes a definite idle or permission. This is not a nicety
  now that the veil swallows the pointer - waiting it out locks the user out of their own browser
  for seconds after they pressed stop, which is how it was reported.

  The engine's own answer is far too slow to hang a pointer block on, and the number is worth
  keeping because it is not intuitive. **Measured end to end against a live agent: 3067ms from the
  keypress to the veil clearing.** That is `UserInterruptCoordinator`'s 3000ms settle window, which
  exists so the engine gives the agent's `PostToolUseFailure` / `Stop` hooks a chance before it
  force-idles a session that might still be working. Right for the engine, wrong for the veil.

  Why it is that slow, and why it felt intermittent: interrupting DURING a tool call fires
  `PostToolUseFailure` with `is_interrupt` and idles at once, while interrupting BETWEEN calls
  fires **no hook at all**. A call runs about 300ms out of every 2s, so the slow path is the
  common one. What a user reads as "it released in ~400ms" is usually not a release at all - it is
  the remainder of the 5000ms link window happening to expire near their keypress.

  So the Ctrl+C handler in `terminal-clipboard.ts` notes the interrupt in `agentDriveStore`
  directly, alongside the existing `notifyUserInterrupt` IPC, and the veil closes on that. A
  COUNTER rather than a flag, because it is an event: a second press must register, and there is
  no sensible moment to reset a flag. Acting on it immediately is safe in the direction that
  matters - if the interrupt did not actually stop the agent, the next drive re-opens the veil
  within a call or two, whereas releasing late costs the user their own browser.

  Use `requiresUserInteraction`, not `!isActive`: it is true only for a DEFINITE state, so an
  unknown or not-yet-loaded activity can never tear the veil down underneath a live drive. That is
  the direction that fails safe, and it is also what
  [[activity-state-classification]] requires - never compare the literals here.

  **Known bounded gap, left open deliberately.** The release is a renderer decision; main's
  `isAgentDriving` still reports true until `DRIVE_BURST_QUIET_MS` after the last call returns. So
  for up to ~400ms after a stop the pane looks and feels interactive while a keystroke into it is
  still intercepted and routed to the terminal. That is the same class this rule exists to close,
  and it is not closed here for two reasons: the misroute lands in the terminal the user was
  already typing in rather than somewhere surprising, and the obvious fix (main flushing the burst
  when a session goes idle) ends the guard early, which fires `restoreIfStolen` and is the one
  thing measured to BREAK a running tool. Closing it needs a signal that distinguishes "the agent
  stopped" from "activity is momentarily stale", which does not exist yet. Do not shorten the veil
  instead - holding it until the burst closes is exactly the ~400ms lag that was reported.

  **Re-measure before retuning.** Every constant here is pinned to that table, and the table is one
  workload on one machine. If the numbers are ever in doubt, read the gaps out of an agent
  transcript again rather than adjusting by feel.
- **The renderer sees a BURST, not a call.** `endAgentInput` debounces its announcement by
  `DRIVE_BURST_QUIET_MS`, and a call arriving inside that window cancels it. Without this the pane
  handed focus back between every consecutive tool call: measured at 810 trusted `focusin` events on
  the terminal during one drive, versus 11 with the debounce. Each of those restores was also a
  window in which the next call's keystrokes could land somewhere other than the guest.
- **Every CDP-driving call announces itself, and the renderer restores.** `withGuest` calls
  `beginAgentInput` / `endAgentInput` (`src/main/browser/agent-input-signal.ts`) around `fn`, with
  the end in a `finally` so a throwing tool still ends the guard. The signal is refcounted, so
  overlapping drives on one pane emit only the outer edges.
- **A keystroke the user makes DURING a drive never reaches the page.** Restoring focus after the
  drive is not enough on its own: for the tens-to-hundreds of milliseconds a drive lasts, the guest
  genuinely holds focus, so the user's typing would flow out of their terminal and into a web form.
  That is a trust failure, not a cosmetic one.

  The two input paths are separable at the guest, which is what makes this fixable: **CDP
  `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` does NOT fire `before-input-event`, while real user input does.** So a
  `before-input-event` arriving while `isAgentDriving(guest.id)` is true is the user's.

  Cite THIS measurement for it, not the earlier `Ctrl+r` A/B: main-side instrumentation, with a
  positive control written at startup so an empty log could not be mistaken for a broken logger,
  recorded ZERO events across a 120-round drive (~3400 dispatched keys), while the user's own
  `Shift` and `Control` presses came through the same handler in the same runs. The `Ctrl+r` A/B
  is unreliable evidence: it ran while the guest held no real focus, so the CDP chord may simply
  never have been delivered, which is indistinguishable from being exempt.

  Main therefore `preventDefault()`s it, encodes it with `encodeTerminalKey`
  (`src/shared/terminal-key-encoding.ts`), and pushes it over `BROWSER_USER_KEY_DURING_DRIVE`; the
  pane routes it to the terminal the user was typing in. Verified end to end: characters typed into
  a driven guest left the page untouched and appeared on the terminal's prompt, and an Enter
  executed the command. Do not "simplify" this to dropping the keystroke - a lost character is
  better than a misdirected one, but neither is the point.

  `encodeTerminalKey` returns null for anything it has no safe mapping for, and null means DROP. A
  wrong byte sequence in a live shell is worse than a missing one, so do not grow that module into a
  general input layer.

  **The destination may also be a TEXT INPUT**, which is a different mechanism, not a
  second spelling of the same one. A terminal takes bytes over IPC; a React-controlled input takes
  a native-setter write plus a dispatched `input` event, and `src/renderer/utils/text-target.ts`
  owns that. Eligibility is ALLOW-BY-DEFAULT - any focused text field in the app qualifies - with
  structural exclusions rather than a maintained list: a `type` that does not hold prose
  (`password` above all), disabled, read-only, a `data-no-text-target` opt-out on the field or an
  ancestor, and **xterm's `.xterm-helper-textarea`**. That last one is the exclusion to never
  remove: it is a real `<textarea>`, so an allow-by-default rule matches it, and routing a terminal
  through the DOM path would write into a hidden node xterm clears on the next keystroke - the text
  vanishes and the shell never sees it.

  `decodeBytesForTextTarget` undoes the terminal encoding for the two cases that are unambiguous -
  a printable character and Backspace - and returns null, meaning DROP, for everything else. It is
  as small as `encodeTerminalKey` for the same reason, and must stay that way. **Enter is in the
  drop set deliberately:** Enter in the note input SENDS the capture and the note to the agent, and
  firing that off a keystroke the user aimed at a web page would post a half-written note with a
  screenshot attached and no way to take it back.
- **The restore happens only AFTER the drive ends, never during it.** The steal does surface as a
  trusted `focusout` on the victim, so an early fire is tempting and was the original design.
  Measured: restoring mid-drive breaks the running tool - `kangentic_browser_type` is a click
  followed by `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` key events, and the same call produced an EMPTY input after a restore and the full
  text without one. Do not reintroduce a `focusout` trigger.
- **"Focus was already inside the pane" does not cover a text input inside the pane.**
  `shouldArmFocusGuard` skips arming when the user was already working in the pane, because a focus
  move within it is theirs, not a steal. The pane's own note input sits inside the pane and is the
  exception: a drive takes focus out of it mid-sentence exactly as it does out of a terminal. So an
  text target arms even when it is inside the pane, and nothing else inside the pane does.
  Keep that exception narrow. A guest the user clicked into surfaces as the `<webview>` element and
  the toolbar is buttons, so neither qualifies - and arming for them would snapshot a terminal
  session and deliver keystrokes there while the user was typing into the page, which is a
  MISROUTE, strictly worse than the drop it would replace.
- **A user gesture disarms the guard only when it names a DIFFERENT target.** The reported bug is
  "type in the terminal while an agent drives", and a drive is short enough that an actively typing
  user lands a keystroke inside it. That keystroke is a trusted `keydown` on the guarded element -
  the user continuing, not choosing elsewhere. Disarming on it makes the fix fail in exactly its own
  repro, intermittently. `isGestureAwayFromGuardedElement` owns that distinction.
- **An agent-initiated window open is stamped, and stamps deny arrival focus.** An IPC push that
  opens or raises a window passes `agentInitiated` through `setDetailTaskId`, which becomes
  `ManagedWindow.openedByAgent` (transient, never persisted - same shape as `skipEnterAnimation`,
  see [[restore-no-animation-replay]]). `resolveArrivalFocus` then denies EVERYONE, including that
  window's own terminal, while such a window holds window-layer focus. Denying everyone is what
  keeps the tier EXCLUSIVE; an allow-the-others tier degrades back into a race. The tier sits BELOW
  the user claim, because clicking a bottom-panel tab moves no `focusedWindowId` and can legitimately
  claim after an agent open. That is not a promise that a claim always survives an agent open:
  `windowFocusFingerprint()` invalidates a pending claim on ANY window open, so one made just before
  dies at tier 1 regardless.
- **`focusWindow` clears the stamp, and the agent path re-stamps after focusing.** The clear happens
  BEFORE the same-id early return, because an agent-opened window IS the focused one, so the user's
  pointer-down on its frame takes exactly that path. Default-by-omission is "user", so a user path
  can never inherit an agent stamp.
- **Dictation deliberately ignores `openedByAgent`.** `resolveFocusedWindowTerminal` is shared
  between dictation and arrival focus and must stay ONE resolver; the two differ in POLICY.
  Dictation is a later user action and must resolve a target; arrival focus must abstain.

  `resolveDictationTarget` resolves a focused TEXT INPUT as a tier ABOVE that shared
  resolver, never by changing it - arrival focus decides which terminal wins among arriving
  terminals and has nothing to say about a focused `<input>`. New non-terminal targets go in the
  same place, for the same reason.
- **Dictating into the GUEST PAGE goes through `executeJavaScript`, never the CDP driver.** This was
  first recorded as a non-goal on the grounds that it needed a new non-agent CDP path; that was
  wrong, and the correction matters because the wrong version would have veiled the pane and armed
  this guard on the user's own dictation. `<webview>.executeJavaScript` runs in the guest
  from the renderer in 1-2ms and touches neither `withGuest` nor the agent-input signal. Keep it
  that way: a guest write must never route through the driver.

  **A password field REFUSES, everywhere, and says so.** It stops the whole resolution rather than
  merely failing eligibility - falling through would route a spoken password into a terminal. The
  concrete reason is that dictation's Cloud refinement engine POSTs raw audio to a configured
  endpoint, so this would send a credential off-machine; on-device engines make it prudence rather
  than protection, but the refusal stays unconditional because engine-dependent behaviour is
  invisible from the field.

  **A dictation guard names the RESOURCE it protects, never "something is busy".** An auto-submit
  paste must not have fresh bytes split its bracketed content, so a press into the terminal that is
  still pasting is refused - and ONLY that terminal. As one global boolean this also refused a
  different terminal, the note input, an app field, and a guest page, none of which can touch a PTY.
  It was silent too, and the window is not short: `terminal-submit.ts` waits for the TUI to settle
  rather than sleeping a fixed amount, so it stretches under load (measured: 2.1s of dead
  push-to-talk). Silent plus global plus seconds long reads as a broken button, which is how it was
  reported. Refuse narrowly and say so on screen.

  **A guest field is FILLED, never submitted.** Auto-submit means pressing Enter, and in someone
  else's page that commits a form we know nothing about. Running the host's multi-field rule on the
  guest's form was tried and removed: it is our inference about a page we do not control, and one
  field is not automatically safe. Do not add a guest submit path back.
- **A guest consumes the mouse, so main forwards its back/forward buttons.** Measured with a real
  mouse: one back press produced 31 events in the page and ZERO on the host window, so no renderer
  listener can see it. `webContents.on('input-event')` is the only hook that does, and it reports a
  real down/up pair. Timestamps come from MAIN, because the renderer's clock is congested by the
  work a press starts and would misfile a tap as a hold. `mouseLeave` must synthesise a release, or
  a press whose pointer leaves the webview strands dictation with the microphone open.
- **No agent-reachable surface autofocuses on mount.** `BrowserEmptyState` can mount from
  `kangentic_browser_open_pane`, so it focuses its URL input only when `focusIsInTypingSurface()` is
  false.
- **A real user gesture is untouched.** A user clicking into the pane still focuses the guest. Focus
  emulation adds a belief; it removes nothing.

## Enforcement (self-maintaining)

- **Test (sites, load-bearing for NEW paths):** `tests/unit/agent-driven-focus-sites.test.ts` scans
  `src/renderer/**` and fails when a file that BOTH subscribes to a main push AND opens a
  task-detail window neither threads the origin nor carries an `// agent-focus-ok: <reason>` marker.
  It additionally pins that the three agent-reachable bridges PASS the origin into the open (checked
  as an argument, not as the identifier appearing somewhere in the file - a presence check passes
  vacuously), that `withGuest` still calls `ensureFocusEmulation` and ends the signal in a `finally`,
  and that nothing under `components/browser/**` autofocuses on mount. It carries a pinned site list
  so a rename cannot silently empty the scan. Writing this scan is what found the Agent Monitor hole
  below.

  Both marker reads go through `tests/unit/helpers/opt-out-marker.ts`, at the scope each scan
  actually needs: the push-and-open scan is file-scoped, because the violation is a pair of
  file-level facts with no one line to point at, while the `autoFocus` scan is line-scoped and
  JSX-aware, because the violation is one attribute. They shared a private `/agent-focus-ok/`
  until then, which had no colon and no anchor, so a bare mention anywhere in a file waived every
  site in it and a comment explaining why a file deliberately does NOT take the opt-out read as
  the opt-out. Verified red-green: reducing `CommandTerminalLayer`'s marker to a bare one, which
  the old reader accepted, now fails the scan by name.
- **Test (chokepoint, load-bearing):** `tests/unit/browser-pane-driver.test.ts` pins that `withGuest`
  arms `ensureFocusEmulation` (on both the attaching and already-attached paths, and never when the
  gate refuses) and brackets `fn` with the begin/end signal including the throwing path. It also pins
  that the driver never calls `focus()` on the guest at ANY capability tier. These fail the moment
  the chokepoint stops buying the property.
- **Test (visible):** `tests/ui/browser-pane-agent-input-focus.spec.ts` pins that a drive marks the
  pane, un-marks it when the drive ends, says it in words, takes no pointer events, and never marks
  a pane whose guest is not the one being driven, and that it swallows the pointer while driving
  and HANDS IT BACK afterwards (both the scrim and the guest's own `pointerEvents`, since a pane
  left inert after a run would be a worse bug than the one blocking fixes). It also pins the four
  properties that define the current treatment against the one it replaced: the terminal stays at
  full opacity throughout, a single isolated call paints nothing, the SECOND call of a run opens
  the veil, and the veil rides straight over the gap between calls instead of blinking per call.
  Another pins the motion by its
  COMPUTED animation (name, `infinite`, and the 1400ms period) rather than by its class, so a
  keyframe deleted, renamed, or lost to the cascade fails loudly - the exact way an activity mark
  once stopped moving for months behind an un-important override.

  The isolated-call case is watched with a `MutationObserver` rather than sampled once the call is
  over, and the distinction is load-bearing: a per-burst cue goes up and comes back down inside the
  wait, so a final read is `false` either way and the test passes against the bug. The assertion is
  that it never went up.

  Its assertions carry explicit timeouts past Playwright's 5s default wherever they wait for the
  run to CLOSE, because `LINK_MS` is 5000ms and the default would race the product. The shared page
  also means a test that leaves a run open leaks it into the next one, so `settleIdle` re-establishes
  a false baseline wherever a test needs one.
- **Test (burst):** `tests/unit/agent-input-burst.test.ts` pins that a run of back-to-back calls
  announces ONE begin, that the end waits for the quiet window, that a call inside that window
  continues the same burst, and that `isAgentDriving` reports true for the WHOLE burst INCLUDING
  the quiet tail. Guarding the tail is deliberate, not an oversight: the pane keeps the guest's
  focus until the burst is announced as over, so gating on the in-flight call alone left exactly
  that window open and 11 of the user's ~62 keystrokes reached the page instead of their terminal.
  Do not narrow it to the in-flight call.
- **Test (CDP payloads):** `tests/unit/browser-input-focus-emulation.test.ts` drives the REAL
  `cdp.ts` through a spying fake debugger and pins that `attachDebugger` alone does NOT enable focus
  emulation (the dev-bridge guard), that `ensureFocusEmulation` sends once per session and re-arms
  after a detach, and the exact mouse/key payloads.
- **Test (unfocused keys):** `tests/unit/browser-keyboard-focus.test.ts` pins `keyboardFocusIsInHost`
  over host, host-subframe, guest, cross-site-iframe and null focused frames, and fails closed when
  the frame cannot be read. It then drives the REAL `cdp.ts` through three refusal cases: an Escape
  with focus in the host sends nothing and throws, a `type` stops at the event where focus leaves
  the pane, and a bare `dispatchKeyEvent` Backspace is refused. Verified red-green: removing the
  check from `dispatchKeyEvent` fails all three. A sibling case pins that a click is still sent,
  since mouse input is hit-tested and is how the pane gets focus. `browser-pane-driver.test.ts` pins the `pane-not-focused` kind, and
  `browser-tools-drive-bodies.test.ts` pins `keypress`'s click-then-press order. Whether
  `focusedFrame` still tracks routing is Chromium behavior no unit tier can see, so
  `tests/e2e/browser-agent-key-focus.spec.ts` drives the real tools against a live guest on CI's
  Linux: a selector-less key with the terminal focused is refused and reaches neither the host
  document nor the page, and a selector delivers it to the page. Verified red-green: with the
  check removed, the agent's key reached the host document. The spec waits for the terminal's
  replay veil to lift before driving, because an arriving terminal's focus can otherwise land
  between the click and the first key and turn a valid call into a refusal. **Re-run the probe on
  an Electron upgrade** anyway, as with gap 2 below, since CI covers Linux and not macOS.
- **Test (text targets):** `tests/unit/text-target.test.ts` pins the pure half of the
  controlled-input mechanism: which element is eligible (allow-by-default, so enabled and
  text-shaped, never `password`, never xterm's helper textarea, and an explicit `data-no-text-target`
  opt-out), that a revised transcript REPLACES its anchored span rather than appending, and that
  the byte decoder drops Enter, Tab, Escape, and the CSI sequences. The DOM half - the native-setter
  write actually reaching React - has no unit tier without jsdom and is covered by the two UI specs
  below, which drive a real controlled input.
- **Test (policy):** `tests/unit/agent-input-focus-guard.test.ts` pins the three pure decisions, in
  particular that a keystroke into the guarded element does NOT disarm, and that a text
  target arms even inside the pane while a non-text element inside the pane still does not.
  `terminal-arrival-focus.test.ts`
  pins the `agent-window` tier. TWO of its cases are constructed so the tier below would have
  ALLOWED - the arriving session matches the agent-opened window's, so tier 2 alone returns
  `window` - and those are the ones proving the tier flips the outcome. The other two arrive with a
  mismatched session that tier 2 would have denied anyway, so they pin PRECEDENCE (the reason is
  `agent-window`, not `window-mismatch`) rather than the flip. Both kinds are wanted; just do not
  read the block as four outcome-flipping cases, because `openedByAgent` rides on the same
  `focusedWindowTerminal` object tier 2 consumes, so a mismatched session cannot flip anything.
- **Test (store):** `tests/unit/window-store-agent-open.test.ts` pins default-by-omission, the
  already-focused clear edge, and that the stamp never reaches the persisted workspace.
- **Test (behavior):** `tests/ui/agent-open-pane-focus.spec.ts` drives the real race - focus task A's
  terminal, fire the `open_pane` push for task B, and assert focus never leaves A - plus the
  CONVERSE, that a user opening the same window still focuses its terminal (a "fix" that merely
  stopped arriving terminals from focusing would pass the first and break the app), and that the
  user's click on the agent-opened frame clears the stamp. Verified red-green: removing
  `openedByAgent` from the bridge moves focus to task B.
  `tests/ui/browser-pane-agent-input-focus.spec.ts` covers the guard and the keystroke routing, to
  a terminal AND to the pane's note input, plus that an intercepted Enter still does not Send.
- **Test (dictation, real flow):** `tests/ui/dictation-note-input.spec.ts` drives the actual
  push-to-talk hotkey against the real note input, so it exercises both things a store write cannot
  reach: the target resolved from `document.activeElement` inside the capture-phase press handler,
  and the native-setter write reaching React rather than only the DOM node. It is the only spec in
  the tree that needs a microphone, so it launches its own browser with Chromium's fake media
  device; no assertion depends on the audio content. Its converse case (focus a terminal, and the
  transcript still goes to the PTY with the note input untouched) is what stops a "fix" that merely
  stopped routing to terminals from passing.
- **Test (real guest):** `tests/e2e/browser-popup-window.spec.ts` is the only tier with a live
  `<webview>`, so it is the only place the popup's origin title and shared `Session` can be checked.
- **Review:** `/code-review` flags a new agent-reachable path that focuses, and a new `openWindow`
  call reachable from an IPC push.

**Mechanical coverage is deliberately incomplete in three places, and these are the gaps:**

1. **Agent-vs-user origin of an IPC push is not statically decidable.** `taskDetailOwnership.onOpenHere`
   serves BOTH the user's card click and the agent's open, and no scan can tell which fired. The
   site scan can only demand that the question be ANSWERED - by threading the origin, or by an
   `// agent-focus-ok:` marker where a human made the call. It cannot verify the answer is right.
   **`onOpenHere` has TWO hosts**, the board bridge and `useMonitorDetailOwnership`; the monitor one
   was missed on the first pass and opened its window unstamped, so an agent-opened detail hosted
   there took focus exactly as before the fix. A new host for this push needs the same stamp.
2. **Whether Chromium's focus propagation is suppressed is not unit-testable at all.** No unit tier
   has a live `<webview>` guest, and the UI tier's is an inert stub. The live probe recorded in the
   PR and the preview rig in `docs/embedded-browser.md` are the only evidence, and an Electron major
   bump can silently change the answer. **Re-run the probe on an Electron upgrade.**
3. **A future CDP input primitive invoked outside a `withGuest` body** is outside the guarantee.
   [[browser-automation-driver]]'s "every driving tool routes through `withGuest`" is what keeps that
   closed, and it is enforced by review, not by type.

## Scope

Agent-driven focus across the main/renderer boundary: the shipped CDP driver and browser-pane
driver, the `kangentic_browser_*` tools, the Browser pane and its empty state, and the
window-manager paths an agent can reach. Does not govern arrival ordering AMONG terminals
([[terminal-arrival-focus]]), the dev-only `kangentic_devtools_*` bridge (which drives Kangentic
itself and is expected to move focus), or a user's own click into a pane.
