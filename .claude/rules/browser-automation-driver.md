# Rule: the browser-automation driver ships; the CDP driver is the single source

The `kangentic_browser_*` MCP tools let an agent drive the user's dev server in a task's embedded
Browser pane (an Electron `<webview>` guest), via Chrome DevTools Protocol attached in-process. This
is a SHIPPED product capability (it targets the user's own app), unlike the dev-only
`kangentic_devtools_*` tools (which debug Kangentic itself over an HTTP bridge and are build-excluded
via `__KANGENTIC_DEV__`). Both surfaces drive CDP through the same helper module. Two risks must stay
closed: the shipped surface accidentally importing dev-only code (dragging it into production), and
the two surfaces forking the CDP driver (so click/type/screenshot semantics drift).

## The rule

- **The CDP driver is shipped and singular.** All `webContents.debugger.*` calls
  (`sendCommand` / `attach` / `detach` / listeners) live in exactly one module:
  `src/main/browser/cdp/cdp.ts`. It operates on a generic `WebContents`. The dev inspection bridge
  consumes it through thin `src/devtools/main/{cdp,screenshot}.ts` BrowserWindow-compat shims; the
  shipped browser-pane driver consumes it directly. Do not add a second `sendCommand` path.
- **Shipped browser-automation code never imports `src/devtools/`.** Files under
  `src/main/browser/**` and the shipped MCP tool files
  (`src/main/agent/mcp-http/browser-tools.ts`, `tool-result.ts`) must not import the dev-only tree.
  Imports flow dev -> shipped only.
- **Every CDP-driving `kangentic_browser_*` tool routes through `browserPaneDriver.withGuest`** and
  declares its capability tier (`observe` / `interact` / `navigate` / `eval`). `withGuest` is the single
  chokepoint that gates the global automation policy, resolves the target pane, attaches CDP, and shapes
  the `{ kind, detail }` error envelope. No tool may attach CDP or read a guest webContents directly.
  There are exactly TWO exceptions, both of which attach no CDP:
  - `kangentic_browser_list_panes`, the discovery tool: it only reads the pane registry (no CDP attach,
    no `sendCommand`) and enumerates every pane rather than resolving one target, so the single-target
    `withGuest` path does not apply. It echoes `automationEnabled` so the agent sees the policy state.
  - `kangentic_browser_close_pane`: closing is renderer state (`browserOpenTasks`), reached by an IPC
    push, so there is no guest to resolve and nothing to drive. It still resolves its single-target
    form through `resolveTarget` and still checks `config.enabled` explicitly, since it never reaches
    `withGuest`'s capability gate. It is annotated MUTATING despite driving no CDP - it changes what is
    on the user's screen.

  `kangentic_browser_open_pane` is NOT an exception: every path that LOADS a URL ends by resolving
  through `withGuest` at the `navigate` tier, which is what makes "the pane is registered AND
  driveable" true rather than merely claimed. Its orchestration lives in
  `src/main/browser/browser-pane-opener.ts`, and the tool passes the tier in explicitly so it sits
  next to the `annotations:` it has to agree with. Its one non-navigating path - the pane is already
  up and no `url` was passed - returns registry status without attaching CDP, so it reports liveness
  (via `resolveLiveGuest`) rather than driveability; do not read the guarantee as covering it.

  Because that tool mutates the screen BEFORE it can reach a guest, it calls the driver's exported
  `capabilityGate` itself, up front. Gating only inside `withGuest` would let a gated-off capability
  open a window and seed a URL and only then refuse. A tool with side effects ahead of its
  `withGuest` call must do the same; the gate stays defined once, in the driver.

  A new tool that drives a pane must still go through `withGuest`.
- **A tool that opens or closes UI is caller-scoped by construction, and says what it did.**
  `open_pane` takes no `sessionId` / `taskId` at all: it targets the caller's own task, so there is no
  argument that could name another project's task. `close_pane` defaults to the caller's project and
  crosses projects only on an explicit `includeOtherProjects`, because a backgrounded project may have
  an agent mid-verification in its pane. Either way the response names the scope it applied and lists
  what it actually closed, so a partial result can never be reported as complete.
- **Every pane target is caller-scoped.** `registerBrowserTools` takes a `BrowserToolDependencies`
  carrying the URL-path `projectId` (always present) and the optional `callerSessionId`, mirroring
  `registerSteeringTools`. `ResolveTargetSelector.projectId` is required and explicitly nullable, so
  every branch of `resolveTarget` refuses a pane outside the caller's project with the
  `foreign-project` kind, and a new call site cannot fall back to process-wide behavior by omission
  (`null` is the deliberate unscoped path: main-process internal callers, plus the ONE opt-in below).
  The family deliberately has NO `project` argument and is deliberately NOT handed the
  `RequestResolver`, so "there is no path to DRIVING another project's pane" is a type-level
  guarantee rather than a convention.

  The single opt-in is `kangentic_browser_close_pane`'s `includeOtherProjects`, which passes
  `projectId: null` for an explicitly named target. It is scoped as narrowly as the feature allows:
  closing is not reading or controlling someone else's page, the flag is off by default, and it
  never widens a DRIVING call. A foreign pane can therefore be seen (`list_panes`) and closed, never
  driven. Any OTHER new `projectId: null` call site on this path is the bug this rule exists to
  catch.
  The `list_panes` exception above is only an exception to `withGuest`: it must still scope to the
  caller's project by default. The pane's registered `projectId` is backfilled in
  `BROWSER_PANE_REGISTER` from the session registry, since the renderer's value is ambient
  `currentProject` and a pop-out window's separate store holds it stale across a project switch.
- **A surface handle names one tab for its lifetime, and a task-bound caller resolves only its own
  task's surfaces.** The registry (`browser-pane-registry.ts`) keys an entry by a handle bound to the
  guest webContents (`pane_<8hex>` minted by main, `lane_<8hex>` by the lane manager), never by the
  agent session id: re-registering the same guest updates its owner in place and keeps the handle,
  and a different guest always gets a new one. It used to key by session id and overwrite on
  register, so one id was observed bound to nine guests in a single agent session and an agent
  holding it silently addressed a different tab (fresh `sessionStorage`) on consecutive calls. A
  handle whose guest is gone is remembered and answers `surface-gone`, naming the replacement; a
  value that was never a handle answers `no-pane-open` with the same pointer. The implicit default
  for a caller with a task resolves that task's ONE surface (its visible pane, else the offscreen
  form of it) and never falls through to another task's pane; that fall-through was observed
  navigating a sibling task's logged-in app to an identity-provider URL. Only a caller with no task
  uses the project-wide single-pane rule. The renderer unregisters by the guest id it registered
  (`BROWSER_PANE_UNREGISTER` takes a `webContentsId`), which is what makes an out-of-order unmount
  structurally unable to clobber a newer registration.
- **A task has exactly ONE browser surface, and no tool argument can create a second.** It is the
  visible `<webview>` pane, or - when no pane can mount, which is only ever a backgrounded project -
  the OFFSCREEN form of the same surface. `openLane` refuses a second for a task
  (`surface-exists`), so the invariant is structural rather than a convention the callers keep.

  `open_pane` had an `isolated: true` argument until 2026-09-21 and it came out. An offscreen
  surface sets no entry in `browserGuestTasks` (written only in `BrowserPane.tsx` on the guest's
  `dom-ready`), so nothing in the UI said one existed, the user could not close it, and every
  supervision guard from [[agent-driven-focus]] - the veil, the ring, the label, the pointer block -
  lives on the pane and reached none of it. An agent completed a whole verification run in one with
  no browser on screen. Do not reintroduce an agent-chosen offscreen surface.

  Three things keep the remaining fallback honest, and a change that drops any of them puts the bug
  back: main pushes the offscreen set to the renderer (`BROWSER_OFFSCREEN_SURFACES`, the whole set
  per change) and the card globe and Browser pill read it alongside `browserGuestTasks`; the task
  menu's Close destroys it (`BROWSER_OFFSCREEN_CLOSE`, since the ordinary close path retires a guest
  id and clears a pane flag and an offscreen surface has neither); and a pane registering for the
  task reclaims it. The reclaim's URL comes from the LIVE guest, never `browserUrlStore` - that
  sidecar is written by the pane on its own `did-navigate`, and main's guest-side bridge is gated on
  `getType() === 'webview'`, so nothing writes it for an offscreen surface.
- **A capture against a non-composited pane must fail fast, never hang.** Chromium stops
  compositing a window that is minimized, hidden, or fully occluded, and `Page.captureScreenshot`
  then never resolves: every later command for that guest queues behind it, wedging the pane for
  good. Two layers, and only the second is a guarantee:
  1. `withGuest` refuses up front with `pane-not-rendering` when
     `BrowserWindow.fromWebContents(guest.hostWebContents)?.isMinimized()`. Minimized is the only
     case main can observe, so this is a nicety that yields a clearer error, not coverage.
  2. `captureScreenshot` races the command against `SCREENSHOT_TIMEOUT_MS` (`cdp/cdp.ts`). This is
     the real backstop, because a merely hidden or occluded window is indistinguishable from a
     visible one through Electron's main-process API (`isVisible()` stays true). Do not remove the
     bound on the strength of the precondition check.
  The same physics is why a retained background pane must be hidden with `opacity: 0` rather than
  `visibility: hidden` or offscreen positioning: those stop compositing, an `opacity: 0` subtree
  does not.
- **A capture of a `<webview>` guest never asks for more pixels than the guest's pane holds.**
  Chromium sizes a capture from the emulated view, the scale factors and the clip, then grows the
  view to match. A guest's view cannot grow, and `CreateTiledBitmap` fills the gap by REPEATING
  the pane, so the agent gets the page tiled in a grid and no error. Every capture is planned by
  `planCapture` (`src/main/browser/cdp/capture-bounds.ts`), which scales anything past
  `widget x display scale` down to fit. `ScreenshotCaptureOptions.surface` is required and
  nullable: a guest caller passes `guestCaptureSurface(webContents, entry)`, and only a surface
  Chromium can grow (a lane's own window, Kangentic's window under the dev bridge) passes `null`.
  `captureScreenshotWithBudget` also refuses, rather than returns, an image larger than the pane,
  which is the backstop if Chromium's sizing ever changes under the planner. Do not "restore
  resolution" by raising the emulated scale factor: that is exactly what shipped the tiling.
- **`eval` is gated off by default.** `kangentic_browser_eval` uses the `eval` capability, which the
  driver blocks unless `AppConfig.browserAutomation.allowEval` is on. Do not ship an ungated
  arbitrary-JS path.

  A scoped DOM operation on ONE resolved node is not an eval path and does not take that gate.
  `selectOptionOnSelector` sets a `<select>`'s value through `Runtime.callFunctionOn` against the
  node's objectId, exactly as `typeText` writes characters: the caller supplies a selector and a
  value, never code. `Runtime.evaluate` with a caller-supplied expression is the line, and it stays
  behind `allowEval`.
- **Every JavaScript dialog is ANSWERED, and that is what makes `Page.enable` safe.** Enabling the
  `Page` domain moves `alert` / `confirm` / `prompt` / `beforeunload` off Chromium's own UI and onto
  the debugger. From that moment the driver owns them: a dialog nobody answers leaves the renderer
  blocked with nothing on screen for the user to dismiss, every later CDP command queues behind it,
  and the pane is wedged until the drive lock times out - the same unrecoverable shape as the
  non-composited capture above, with no backstop.

  So `attachDebugger`'s message listener responds to every `Page.javascriptDialogOpening`, records
  it in a ring, and defaults to DISMISS (the safe direction for all four types). Never enable `Page`
  without that handler, and never add an early return that could skip it.

  The response is ARMED AHEAD of the action rather than chosen after it, and that is forced rather
  than stylistic: a pending dialog blocks the renderer, so the tool call that would answer it could
  not run. `kangentic_browser_handle_dialog` sets the response for the next dialog (or persistently);
  the agent arms, then clicks. Do not redesign this as a reactive prompt.

  **A drive must not outrun `Page.enable`.** `attachDebugger` is synchronous and its other domain
  enables are fire-and-forget, so the FIRST drive on a guest used to run while `Page.enable` was
  still in flight - and a click that opened a `confirm()` in that window raced ahead of the
  interceptor. `withGuest` therefore awaits `waitForDialogInterception` before running any tool
  body. Every later call finds it already settled. Do not move the enable back to fire-and-forget,
  and do not add a drive path that skips the await.

  **Electron draws its OWN dialog too, so the guest is created with `disableDialogs: true`.**
  Measured on Electron 41, and it is not what the CDP docs imply: enabling `Page` and answering
  `javascriptDialogOpening` does NOT stop Electron's delegate. Both fired. The page took our CDP
  answer and carried on while a native "Really delete?" box stayed on screen whose OK and Cancel
  then did nothing, because the answer had already been given - so the box was not redundant, it
  was a lie about what the page would do, and the user had to dismiss one per dialog. The
  suppression lives in `will-attach-webview` (`src/main/index.ts`), where the guest's
  webPreferences are already hardened, because Electron's delegate is not something the CDP path
  sits in front of. Verified after the change that `accept: true` and the default dismiss both
  still work, so suppressing the box costs no control.

  **`prompt()` never reaches any of this on Electron**: it is unimplemented and throws in the page
  rather than opening a dialog, so `promptText` is unreachable for a `<webview>` guest. It stays in
  the API because the CDP path handles it correctly and a future runtime may deliver one.
- **Detach is synchronous on shutdown.** `browserPaneRegistry.detachAll()` runs in the synchronous
  `before-quit` path (see [[synchronous-shutdown]]); never make it async.

## Enforcement (self-maintaining)

- **Test:** `tests/unit/browser-automation-invariants.test.ts` scans `src/` and fails if a
  `webContents.debugger.*` call appears outside `src/main/browser/cdp/cdp.ts`, or if shipped
  browser-automation code imports `src/devtools/`. `tests/unit/browser-pane-registry.test.ts` and
  `browser-pane-driver.test.ts` lock target resolution, self-healing eviction, capability gating, and
  the navigation-URL policy. `tests/unit/mcp-browser-tools-project-scope.test.ts` is the
  caller-scoping guard: it enumerates the REGISTERED tools at runtime and fails when one has no
  entry in its args map, so a newly added browser tool cannot ship unscoped even though this rule
  may not be loaded when it is written. Run in CI via `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (one surface per task):** `tests/unit/browser-lane-manager.test.ts` pins that `openLane`
  refuses a second surface for a task and names the one that exists, that a pane's return reclaims
  it, and that every change announces the offscreen set.
  `tests/unit/browser-pane-opener.test.ts` pins the routing either side of it: the offscreen
  fallback is unreachable while the project is open, an existing offscreen surface is returned
  rather than duplicated, a visible pane outranks it, and the reclaim resolves the LIVE guest's URL
  over the saved sidecar (red-green: deleting that preference fails the case).
  `tests/unit/mcp-server-instructions-browser.test.ts` fails if `isolated: true` reappears in the
  server instructions, where it would send an agent to a zod schema error instead of a browser.
- **Test (pane-bounded capture):** `tests/unit/browser-capture-bounds.test.ts` holds its own
  statement of Chromium's `requested_image_size` rule, checks it reproduces the shipped bug, and
  asserts no planned capture exceeds its pane across display scales 1 to 2, four pane sizes, and
  every zoom, ratio and target shape. `tests/unit/devtools-screenshot-budget.test.ts` pins the
  refusal of an oversized image. The required `surface` field makes a new call site decide at
  typecheck.
- **Test (visible in the UI):** `tests/ui/browser-offscreen-surface.spec.ts` drives the real board
  and task detail: the card globe and the pill's alive dot light for an offscreen surface and go
  dark when it closes, only the holding task lights, the set is read on mount as well as pushed,
  and the task menu's Close reaches it with this task's project. Each case carries its converse,
  because both indicators render on a boolean OR and a one-sided test passes against a component
  that ignores the new half.
- **Review:** `/code-review` flags a new `kangentic_browser_*` tool that bypasses `withGuest`, an
  ungated eval path, a shipped import of `src/devtools/`, or a `resolveTarget` / `withGuest` call
  site that passes `projectId: null` without being a main-process internal caller.

## Drift over time

New `kangentic_browser_*` tools and new CDP helpers get added as the surface grows, and the
read-trigger gap means this rule may not be loaded when that happens. The single-driver and
no-devtools-import scans are the mechanical backstop: a forked `sendCommand` or a prod->dev import
fails CI the first time it runs, independent of whether this rule was in context. When the tool list
grows, keep each new tool's body going through `withGuest`; when a new CDP primitive is needed, add it
to `src/main/browser/cdp/cdp.ts`, never a second module.

## Scope

The shipped browser-pane automation surface: `src/main/browser/**`, the `kangentic_browser_*` tools,
and the shared CDP driver. The dev-only inspection bridge and `kangentic_devtools_*` tools under
`src/devtools/` are governed by [[dev-tooling-build-exclusion]].
