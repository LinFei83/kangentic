# Rule: the web build is the real renderer, kept at parity by machinery, not by hand

`npm run build:demo` builds the desktop renderer for a plain browser (`dist/demo/`), where the
site and the docs embed it to show the actual app rather than a screenshot or a recreation. It is
the same `src/renderer` bundle the Electron build ships, running against the in-browser mock of
the bridge (`tests/ui/mock-electron-api.js`) and seeded with the sample install
(`tests/captures/helpers/demo-dataset.ts`). Parity with the desktop app is therefore a property of
three things staying in step, and each is enforced rather than remembered.

## The rule

- **Every method on `ElectronAPI` has a mock implementation.** A bridge method the mock lacks is
  a silent runtime failure in the web build. Add the mock method in the same change that adds the
  interface member. An OPTIONAL member (`foo?:`) is exempt from the parity test by construction,
  so the skip list is pinned: adding one is a decision, not a side effect. That list grew silently
  once, which is how the message trail reached the demo with no mock data behind it.
- **Demo behaviour lives outside `src/renderer`.** The URL contract, the config overrides, the
  still and embed styles, and the scene applier are `demo/boot.js` and the scene registry
  (`tests/captures/scenes.ts`); the fixed-size host a direct visit lands on is `demo/stage.html`.
  Renderer code never reads `location`, never checks a demo flag,
  and never branches on being embedded. The one renderer concession is a `data-testid` on the
  window-controls cluster so the demo can hide it by selector.
- **A scene is data.** Config overrides, task-row patches, session activity, `__mock*` seeds, and
  at most a short list of boot steps: a click, a typed query, or a held hotkey, each a state and
  none a choreography (no timing, no narration). No code travels through a scene or a `state=`
  URL. A scene the demo cannot build (`reach: 'driver'`) is refused loudly, never approximated;
  its gesture (a `hover`, a `contextmenu`, a `drag` that may `hold`) is data too, and only the
  capture rig plays it.
- **A surface Electron alone provides is mocked as a surface, never faked as content.** The
  `<webview>` tag has an iframe standing in for it (`demo/webview-shim.js`), loading a bundled
  page at the project's dev URL whose data is the project's own and nothing invented. Its
  presentation, the layout and the styling, is the one authored part: the scaffold's
  `src/App.tsx` renders a bare heading and list, and rebuilding it would invalidate the
  recordings that edit that file (`demo/README.md`, Browser guest). The microphone is a silent
  stream so dictation's real pipeline runs, and no transcript is authored. A silent microphone
  transcribes to nothing, so `dictation.stop` answers empty. The Dictation tab's model list is
  main's own `buildDictationInfo` over a seeded machine. Git history is a real repository built
  from a commit plan and read with git. The line is the same one the terminal rule draws: mock the bridge, record or
  derive the content, and where content cannot be honest, show the surface without it. Every entry carries the three fields that leave this repo: `alt`, the
  reader-facing text a docs figure carries; `ready`, the selector the frame is built at; and an
  optional `focus`, the element whose rect the ready message reports (a selector list names
  several, and the rect is the box around all of them). The registry has two
  consumers by construction (`demo/boot.js` at `view=`, the rig at
  `tests/captures/features/scenes.capture.ts` against the BUILT demo) and the rig keeps no
  applier of its own, so the two cannot describe one state two ways.
- **The site learns the list from the build, never from a copy.** The build emits `scenes.json`
  unhashed beside `index.html`, generated from `SCENES`: name, reach, alt, description, and the
  app version. A vendored or packaged copy can lag what is deployed; a URL cannot. The poster set
  the site's figures fall back to (`demo/posters.mjs`, attached to every release as
  `demo-posters-<version>.zip`) is shot by the rig from that same build, and its `manifest.json`
  carries that same `version`, so the site can refuse a set that is not the demo it deploys. It
  also carries each poster's `focus` rect, measured through `boot.js`'s own
  `__demoBoot.focusRectOf`, so a poster crop and the live frame's ready message are one measure.
- **The sample install is one dataset.** The marketing captures and the web build both seed
  `demo-dataset.ts`; terminal content comes from recordings in `tests/captures/fixtures/demo/`
  made by `scripts/capture-agent-scrollback.js` and sanitized at record time. There is no
  hand-authored terminal content, and the build refuses to seed a session without a recording.
- **What a visitor can start is recorded too.** The transition engine is not in a browser, so a
  drag into an auto-spawn column and a new Command Terminal replay boots the matrix records from
  the dataset (one per task and permission mode, one per project), announced through the same
  pushes main sends. Never fake a spawn with generated bytes or a hand-written transcript.
- **A session's clock is the recording's, and it runs whether or not a terminal is open.** A
  session the board shows as working opens its recording a fixed span before the end and plays
  that span out; when a recording that ran to the agent's own end reaches it, the session flips to
  needs-you, as main's activity engine does when a turn completes. The card, the sidebar count and
  the Monitor therefore change at the moment a window would show the answer land, not when the
  visitor happens to open one. A still frame paints that same opening moment, so a capture and the
  live frame start from the same place.
- **A card's own text is recorded too, and a mock that answers with nothing is not parity.** Card
  Preview defaults to `agent-latest-message`, so a card prints the agent's newest message rather
  than the description. That prose is in the agent's transcript, never in the terminal bytes. Each
  recording carries a `messageTrail`, derived by importing main's own parsers and
  `assistantMessagePreviews`, on the recording's own clock. It is seeded before the renderer
  mounts, and the rest is scheduled from there.
  Unlike the timelines this cannot be recomputed from a recording, so the
  lines are committed and the guard asserts presence. A trail that is legitimately empty (no
  transcript parser for that agent, a transient Command Terminal, a capture whose prose was all
  thinking blocks) is enumerated with its reason rather than left to read as a gap. This is the
  shape to watch for on every new data-backed card surface: the bridge method existing and
  returning nothing passes every structural check while the feature is invisible.
- **What the Monitor shows moving is recorded too.** A card's output peek changes as the agent
  works, so each recording carries the timeline of those changes (`peekTimeline`), derived from
  its own stream by one shared module and sampled to a readable cadence with no random number in
  it, because the built files are content-hashed. A frame showing only the Monitor still fetches
  no recording. `loop=1` restarts a finished session on its own clock and repaints a mounted
  terminal from the opening frame rather than re-feeding its history; it is off by default, and
  a still frame arms no timer at all.
- **A terminal fills its pane, plays its recording's bytes only on the recording's grid, and is
  never left dead or finished.** A recording's bytes address rows for their own grid, which no
  page can promise: the board's bottom panel is 15 rows against a session's 37, and a grid moves
  with the host's frame size and the visitor's display scale. Bytes go only to a terminal on the
  recording's grid. Every other grid plays the recording through the page's own emulator
  (`demo/replay-emulator.ts`): the bytes written into a terminal at the RECORDED grid on the
  session's clock, and the visitor's terminal repainted from it as PHYSICAL rows with an absolute
  cursor (`scripts/lib/demo-frame-serializer.js`), with the rows above the screen a taller grid
  shows. A repaint builds on the last one (rows scrolled into the terminal's own scrollback, the
  screen redrawn in place), so a visitor scrolled up through the history stays there. The
  terminal is never letterboxed, since that empty band was on nearly every surface at some scale.
  A pane at least the recording's width, or a column or two short (`NEAR_MISS_COLUMNS`), keeps the
  configured type at its own grid; one further short is HELD at a smaller type
  (`SessionResizeResult.held`, `useTerminal`'s `conformToHeldGrid`) at the grid the WHOLE pane
  takes there (`displayFor`), predicted from the conform's rule, which lands on the largest size
  that fits; below `HOLD_MIN_SCALE` it keeps the configured type and is cut. Rows never set the
  type. The applier fits each row to the grid: cut at the edge, never wrapped; a row ending in a
  vertical border or scrollbar keeps that glyph at the edge; on a WIDER grid, what the CLI drew to
  its own edge (a border or scrollbar, a background band, a rule, a panel's padding, right-aligned
  text after a wide gap) is drawn to the new one, and only from rows that reached the recorded
  edge or its padding; text the CLI filled the width with (a row to the edge itself, a line cut
  with an ellipsis, code after an indentation gap) stays as recorded; a vertical bar is never
  extended sideways and a one-cell gap never grown; a TALLER
  alternate screen grows its rows above its footer. A grid mismatch is also not an ending: main
  routes a geometry-changed session to its parsed frame on the desktop and the agent goes on
  working, so a working session here keeps its clock, its card and its Monitor peeks, and the
  emulator plays on that clock from a spawn's start and through a resize. Never conflate "cannot
  replay these bytes" with "the agent finished", never answer a grid mismatch with a second
  recording at that grid (the grid is not stable enough to record against), and never hand the
  serialize addon's joined rows to a terminal of another width. A tiled LAYOUT is a surface, not
  a mismatch: the matrix records a session at the tiled width too when the manifest names a
  `tiled` sibling, at the grid `node demo/measure.mjs --geometry` measures for that surface at the
  launch the manifest's `geometry` names, and the seed shows whichever of the two the window's
  pane shows better (`layoutFor`). The sibling is a second run of the prompt, so it supplies the
  terminal's bytes only; the session's clock, trail, diff, and peeks stay the single recording's.
  A still a tiled window paints is the sibling's own open frame, cut by the backfill at the moment
  the single's clock opens the session, with the rows above its screen.
- **A floating terminal window that is the subject of its scene is sized to its recording, not
  given a fixed fraction.** The cell's width depends on the display (xterm floors it to device
  pixels) and on the font the visitor has, so no fraction of the frame fits every visitor, and a
  pane of any other width shows the recording widened or scaled rather than as recorded. The scene marks
  the window `fitToRecording` with its session, and the seed sets its width before the renderer
  mounts from the cell and the scrollbar gutter measured the way the renderer measures them. A
  marker naming a session with no recording is a console error, never a quiet fallback.
- **The conversation viewer shows a recorded transcript, or the mock's empty answer, never a
  written one.** A session the manifest marks `transcript` carries the agent's own transcript
  beside its recording (`transcripts/<file>`, main's parsers over the history file the agent
  wrote, sanitized whole, committed because the source lives on the recording machine), and the
  seed serves it through `transcripts.get` when a viewer opens. Every other session falls through
  to the mock's empty response, which is what the desktop shows once a history file is gone.
- **The `demo` Playwright tier stays green**, and it runs on the exact bytes a release deploys.

## Enforcement (self-maintaining)

- **Test (mechanical, CI):** `tests/unit/mock-electron-api-parity.test.ts` parses the
  `ElectronAPI` interface with the TypeScript compiler API, evaluates the mock in a `node:vm`
  context, and fails on any declared method the mock does not implement. Runs via
  `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (mechanical, CI):** `tests/unit/demo-fixtures-sanitized.test.ts` scans every recording
  and the dataset modules for a home directory, a user name, an email address, a temp path, or a
  client name. Runs via `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (mechanical, CI):** `tests/unit/demo-message-trail-seeded.test.ts` fails when a recording
  carries no `messageTrail` key, when one is empty without a named reason, when a named reason has
  gone stale, when a line sits outside its recording's span, and when the applier or the loader
  stops reading them. It is the answer to the parity test passing on a mock that answers with
  nothing. Runs via `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (mechanical, CI):** `tests/unit/demo-dictation-info.test.ts` fails when the sample
  install's `dictation.getInfo` answer stops resolving a live and a refinement model, stops offering
  either in its dropdown's list, or stops reporting both as cached. It is the same guard as the
  message trail's, for the Dictation tab: the mock's own answer lists no models, so every structural
  check passed while both model rows read None. Runs via `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (mechanical, CI):** `tests/unit/demo-transcript-seeded.test.ts` fails when the session
  the `conversation` scene opens has no transcript file, when the file is not a whole conversation
  in the parser's shape, when its entries are not the run the card's trail came from (the trail's
  uuids are transcript uuids), when a marked manifest entry has no file or a file no mark, and when
  the build or the seed stops reading them. Runs via `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (mechanical, CI):** `tests/unit/demo-guest-pages.test.ts` reads every `guest_page`
  `DEMO_PROJECTS` names and fails when the file is missing, references anything off-origin, reads
  `prefers-color-scheme`, or declares an animation or transition. Runs via `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (mechanical, CI):** `tests/unit/demo-frame-format.test.ts` fails when any recording's
  final frame, open frame, or timeline frame is not physical rows with a cursor suffix, or holds a
  row wider than the recording's columns (the "run the backfill" backstop);
  `tests/unit/demo-frame-serializer.test.ts` round-trips the serializer, including the two
  recordings from task #673, and `tests/unit/demo-frame-fit.test.ts` runs the applier lifted out
  of the GENERATED seed over those recordings at the grids that broke (no spill, no stripe, the
  cursor on its row, Copilot's scrollbar one unbroken line at 153 columns), runs EVERY recording
  1, 9 and 64 columns wider and holds it to drawing at the new last column whatever it drew at its
  own (border, scrollbar, rule, background), and grows a taller Copilot frame above its footer;
  `tests/unit/demo-cell-widths.test.ts` pins the applier's width table to
  `wcwidthV11`; `tests/unit/demo-layout-choice.test.ts` lifts `displayFor` and `layoutFor` out of
  the same generated seed with the cell measurement injected (a linear face and one whose heights
  round unevenly) and pins that every held pane lands, under the conform's rule, on the cell the
  seed predicted and fills its pane to within a cell each way at 100, 125, 150 and 200 percent,
  plus which recording a pane takes; `tests/unit/demo-tiled-frames-loaded.test.ts` checks each
  tiled still against an independent replay of the tiled stream and refuses a tiled recording
  whose open frame is missing or cut for another moment. Run via `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (behavior, CI):** `tests/ui/terminal-held-grid-conform.spec.ts` drives the renderer's
  conform against the mock's held answer: a held grid is taken at a smaller font, at the LARGEST
  quarter-pixel size that still holds it (one step up must not fit), an accepted probe releases
  it, and a plain refusal conforms nothing.
- **Test (mechanical, CI):** `tests/unit/scene-registry.test.ts` runs over the real `SCENES`
  and fails when a reach tag disagrees with the steps (a `state` scene with steps, a `boot` scene
  with a rig step, a `driver` scene with none), when `alt`, `ready`, or `description` is missing
  or an alt carries a dash or a curly quote (the writing-style scan excludes `tests/`, so this is
  the only check the alts get), when a patched task or session id is not one the sample install
  seeds, when a config key is not an `AppConfig` key (the mock's `Object.assign` accepts any key
  and the renderer never reads it), when the settings scenes stop matching `SETTINGS_TABS` one to
  one or a `setting-row-<id>` marker names a row that is not on that tab, when a `fitToRecording`
  names a session the recordings index does not carry, and when `boot.js`'s
  `STATE_KEYS` or `demo/vite.config.mts`'s `scenes.json` fields drift from the type. Runs via
  `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (behavior, CI):** `tests/demo/static-demo.spec.ts` boots EVERY bootable scene in the
  registry from a static server (the loop iterates `SCENES`, so a new entry is covered with no
  test change, and a stale deep marker for a retired scene fails) and asserts its `ready` element
  visible and, where the scene names a `focus`, that the element exists and covers a real region
  of the frame (not empty, not the whole frame: the Quick Find scenes once named the palette's
  full-frame backdrop, which crops to nothing) and that each selector in it matches exactly one
  element, that a `driver` scene is refused by name, that `scenes.json` is served, lists exactly
  the registry, and names the frame's version, that the ready message posted to an iframe host
  carries a dialog scene's focus rect (the same rect `__demoBoot.focusRectOf` hands the poster
  rig) and null for a scene without one, the embed and theme
  parameters, the error card for an
  unknown scene, a clean console, zero off-origin requests, that a still frame fetches no
  recording, that the live frame fetches its session's recording, that a live Monitor's output
  peeks change while a still frame's do not, that `loop=1` brings a finished session back and its
  absence leaves it finished, that a terminal on a grid its recording does not fit plays through
  the emulator and leaves its session working (including the board's bottom panel, where no grid
  could fit), that every terminal scene fills its panes at device scale 1, 1.25 and 2 and as a
  still at 2, and that bytes reach a terminal only on one of its recordings' grids, that a held
  terminal reporting its conformed grid back is read as the conform landing
  rather than a resize, so a session already at its recording's end receives nothing,
  that a board card and a Monitor card draw the agent message trail in place of the
  description and the output peek while a session with no trail still draws its peek, that a
  drag into an
  auto-spawn column and a new Command Terminal each start a session whose bytes arrive through
  the mock's data path, that a still whose terminal is narrower than its recording and not held
  paints its frame cut to the grid rather than raw, that the conversation scene renders the
  recorded transcript from one `transcripts/` fetch and no recording, that the tiled task
  windows take each session's tiled recording and fill their panes, that a fitted floating window
  takes exactly its recording's columns at device scale 1, 1.25, and 2 and in a launch whose
  scrollbars reserve a gutter, that a window built one cell narrower than its fitted width (one
  column short on any font) keeps the configured type with nothing held, that a card opened
  in that launch at 100 percent fills its window, and that Escape posts `kangentic-demo-escape`
  only when the app has nothing of its own to close. A dialog, a task window, and a focused text
  field each keep the first press. A task window whose terminal is under the pointer still closes
  on it. A parked window, a Command Terminal, and a terminal outside every task window keep no
  press, so the first press posts. Runs as the `demo` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  and again inside `.github/workflows/deploy-demo.yml` before the Pages deploy.
- **Review:** `/code-review` flags a `location` check or a demo flag inside `src/renderer`, and a
  scene entry that carries code instead of data.

## Scope

The web build (`demo/`), the mock bridge, the scene registry and dataset under `tests/captures/`,
and the `demo` tier. The Electron build and the UI test tier are unaffected: the web build is a
separate Vite invocation and never touches `.vite/build/`.
