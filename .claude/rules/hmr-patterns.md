# Rule: HMR dev-mode parity (patterns A-E)

The team dogfoods Kangentic from `npm start` daily, so a Vite Fast Refresh during a real
session must be visually and behaviourally indistinguishable from a fresh production boot. Five
primitives cover every HMR-sensitive surface; mixing them up causes flaky behavior that only
surfaces in dev, the exact failure mode this project cannot tolerate. Pick the right pattern up
front rather than reaching for ad-hoc fixes later.

## The rule

| Pattern | When to reach for it | How to apply | Example sites |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Preserve** | Module-scope state (timers, AbortControllers, caches, counters, scroll positions) that must survive a reload | `let x = import.meta.hot?.data?.x ?? <default>;` plus `import.meta.hot?.dispose((d) => { d.x = x; })` | `task-slice.ts` (`moveGenerations`), `session-store.ts` (`syncController`, transient sessions), `useTerminal.ts` (`savedScrollPositions`), `toast-store.ts`, `hmr-generation.ts`, `auto-name-scheduler.ts` |
| **B. Re-sync** | Zustand stores whose truth lives in the main process (IPC-backed) | Add a `load*` / `sync*` call to the `vite:afterUpdate` handler in `App.tsx` | `loadBoard()`, `loadBacklog()`, `loadConfig()`, `loadProjects()`, `syncSessions()` |
| **C. Re-key remount** | Stateful third-party React subtrees whose subscriptions go stale across Fast Refresh (every `<DndContext>`) | `const hmrGeneration = useHmrGeneration();` then `<DndContext key={hmrGeneration}>` | All 5 `<DndContext>` sites: `KanbanBoard`, `BacklogView`, `PrioritiesPopover`, `ProjectSidebar`, `ShortcutsTab` |
| **D. Cleanup** | Imperative DOM or global state no React component owns | Add the clear to the top of the `vite:afterUpdate` handler | `.drop-highlight` class removal in `App.tsx` |
| **E. Pin instance** | A Zustand store whose only runtime export is the non-component hook, so the module is not a Fast Refresh boundary and a re-eval can hand a SECOND store to part of the tree | `const make = () => create<T>(init); export const useX = import.meta.hot?.data?.x ?? make();` plus `import.meta.hot.data.x = useX; import.meta.hot.accept(() => import.meta.hot.invalidate())` | `board-store.ts`, `backlog-store.ts`, `announcements-store.ts`, and the rest of `PATTERN_E_STORES` in `tests/unit/hmr-resync.test.ts` (the authoritative list) |

**Decision tree:**

1. New IPC-backed Zustand store, or a new `load*` / `sync*` method on an existing one? Pattern
   B: add a call in `App.tsx`'s `vite:afterUpdate` handler.
2. Is that store's only runtime export the non-component hook (`export const useXStore =
   create(...)`, no component exports)? Then the module is not a Fast Refresh boundary, so a
   re-eval (a slice edit, or an edit to a store it imports) can construct a second instance while
   the mounted view stays subscribed to the first. Pattern E: pin the instance via
   `import.meta.hot.data` and self-accept with `accept(() => invalidate())`. Pair with Pattern B.

   **The self-accept is unsafe inside an import CYCLE.** Vite answers an `invalidate()` raised
   from a module that participates in a cycle by abandoning the hot update:

   ```
   page reload src/renderer/stores/project-store.ts (circular import invalidate)
   ```

   A full page reload destroys every live Browser pane `<webview>` guest AND every
   `import.meta.hot.data` pin, so it is strictly worse than the stale closures the self-accept
   exists to prevent. Two stores hit this. `project-store` <-> `session-store` was broken outright
   (`stores/session-lifecycle-hooks.ts` late-binds the two session actions project-store needed, so
   project-store no longer imports session-store; the `session-store` -> `project-store` edge stays,
   but one direction is not a cycle) and is now guarded by
   `tests/unit/renderer-store-import-cycles.test.ts`. `session-store` sits in a SECOND cycle that
   cannot be designed away - it needs the arrival-focus arbiter, which needs to know which terminal
   the user is looking at, which needs session state - so it PINS WITHOUT SELF-ACCEPTING, and says
   so at the pin. Prefer breaking the cycle; drop the self-accept only when the cycle is intrinsic,
   and write down which one it is.
3. New `<DndContext>` or other React component wrapping a third-party library with internal
   subscription state? Pattern C: pair it with `useHmrGeneration()` and `key={hmrGeneration}`.
4. New module-scope `let` / `const` mutable state (Maps, Sets, AbortControllers, counters) under
   `src/renderer/stores/` or `src/renderer/utils/`? Pattern A: preserve via
   `import.meta.hot.data`, or annotate the declaration with `// hmr-safe: <reason>` if
   reset-on-HMR is intentional.
5. Imperatively setting a class, attribute, or global handle React will not tear down? Pattern
   D: add the clear to the `vite:afterUpdate` handler.

**Anti-patterns:** do not combine A and C on the same state; do not add an undocumented ad-hoc HMR
workaround (surface the gap and extend this catalog deliberately); do not gate Pattern A behind
`process.env.NODE_ENV` (`import.meta.hot` is `undefined` in production builds, so the guards
already collapse to no-ops).

## Enforcement (self-maintaining)

- **Test:** `tests/unit/hmr-resync.test.ts` enforces four things: every IPC-backed store's
  `load*` / `sync*` is called in `App.tsx`'s `vite:afterUpdate` (B); every module-scope mutable
  declaration under the watched dirs has `import.meta.hot.dispose(` or a `// hmr-safe:` opt-out
  (A); every `<DndContext>` has `key={hmrGeneration}` (C); and each instance-pinned store
  (the test's `PATTERN_E_STORES` array - extend it whenever a store adopts the pin) reads and
  writes its instance in `import.meta.hot.data` and self-accepts (E). Runs in CI via
  `npm run test:unit`.
- **Test (cycles):** `tests/unit/renderer-store-import-cycles.test.ts` fails on any value-import
  cycle under `src/renderer/stores/**`, naming the loop. This is the mechanical guard for the
  circular-import reload above; it follows value imports only, since `import type` is erased and
  cannot create a runtime edge. Runs in CI via `npm run test:unit`.
- **Review:** the `hmr-parity` agent audits all five patterns; `hmr-integrity` is the narrow
  Pattern B store-registration check.

- **Test (hook-shaped locals):** `tests/unit/hook-shaped-locals.test.ts` fails on any INDENTED
  `const`/`let` whose name starts with `use` + an uppercase letter, under `src/renderer/**`.
  react-refresh's Babel transform reads such a call as a custom hook, cannot put a local binding
  in the component's refresh signature, and falls back to `forceReset: true` - so React REMOUNTS
  the component on every Fast Refresh of its module instead of preserving state. Five window-manager
  components had `const useStore = useLayerStore()`, which is why every task-detail window was
  rebuilt (and every live pane guest destroyed) whenever anything in its import chain refreshed,
  with no page reload and no bailout to point at. Opt out with `// hook-local-ok: <reason>` on the
  declaration or in the comment block directly above it (`tests/unit/helpers/opt-out-marker.ts` is
  the shared reader; it requires the reason, and the marker has to open a comment, so prose that
  quotes one does not count). Runs in CI via `npm run test:unit`.

**The `use` prefix is load-bearing on locals, not stylistic.** This is the third and subtlest of the
three ways a dev-mode save killed a Browser pane guest, and the only one with no visible symptom in
the HMR log at all - the pane simply came back as a new element. Bisecting it needed the probe:
editing `AppLayout.tsx` did NOT remount (the memoized frame skipped the render entirely), editing
`WindowFrame.tsx` did, and renaming one local fixed it.

## Scope

Renderer code under `src/renderer/`. Main-process state is not subject to HMR (esbuild does not
Fast-Refresh the main process).

`config-store.ts` shares Pattern E's shape (its only runtime export is the non-component hook) and
is a candidate for the same instance pinning; it currently relies on Pattern B re-sync. Extend the
Pattern E test's store list when pinning it.

`session-store.ts` IS pinned, and is the one store that pins without self-accepting (see the
decision tree's step 2). It also keeps its Pattern A dispose stash: the pin means the initializer
does not re-run on a Fast Refresh, so the stash covers only the transition with no pinned instance
to inherit (the first HMR after a cold boot or a full reload), plus `syncController`, which is
module state and has no instance to ride.

## Measuring it

Do not reason about whether an HMR change preserves a live Browser pane - measure:

```
node scripts/hmr-guest-probe.mjs
```

It boots a headless Vite dev server on the real renderer config, mounts a task's Browser pane
against the UI-tier mock, registers a guest, hides it (the held state), makes a comment-only edit
to a target file, and reports whether the page reloaded, whether the guest's `webContentsId`
survived, whether the pane REMOUNTED (a new element, which a DOM-presence check cannot see), and
Vite's own reload reason. It exits non-zero when the guest dies. `--file <path>` targets a
different module, which is how a remount is bisected to the module that causes it.

Two traps it exists to avoid. Vite's reload reason prints only to the DEV SERVER terminal, so a
`/preview` session cannot show it; the probe captures it with a `customLogger`. And
`vite.config.mts` ignores the RELATIVE glob `**/.kangentic/**`, so in a worktree checkout (which
lives at `<repo>/.kangentic/worktrees/<n>`) that glob swallows the whole source tree and the
watcher never fires - the probe uses `scripts/dev.js`'s absolute-path ignores instead, which is
also what the dogfooded `npm start` runs.
